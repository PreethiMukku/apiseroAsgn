*Fail Over-> Switching to another server when the primary server fails.
Failover is the ability to seamlessly and automatically switch to a reliable backup system.


***Load Balancers : When we have many servers then we are using load balancers to distribute the load equally on the servers .
(handling requests by switching servers).

***Cluster : collection of servers working as a single unit. 


Example 

www.abc.com------->LoadBalancer------>server1 / server2
(20.10.10.12)			(20.10.10.10)/ (20.10.10.11)

Single Servers

	*Less Network Calls 
	*Small Code Base
	*Less Third Party Communication 
	*Less Load 
	
Distributed Server 
	*More Network Calls 
	*Large Code Base
	*There are third party dependencies(payment gateways)
	*Concurrency/load is high.
	
------------------------Monolithic ---------------
(Huge Application)
Monolithic is the architecture where we have all the services in one unit. It is basically used when we need to develop
small software and when load is less 

---------------Microservices--------------------------------------------
Where as in microservices we divide the work in smaller units where each unit is responsible for performing different Fucntions
Each project and services are independent from each other at the code level.

BENIFITS:

1)Independent service increase the speed of experimentation
2)Services can be build with diverse set of technologies
3)Services have independent cycles
4)Growth and scale of system becomes good
5)Separately portable
6)ess dependencies over central server
7)Debugging and maintenance will be easy
8)Flexible to make changes
9)Easier to track the progress

DISADVANTAGES:
1)Being more complicated than most monolithic applications
2)Requiring cultural changes
3)Often are more expensive than monoliths
4)an present security threats
