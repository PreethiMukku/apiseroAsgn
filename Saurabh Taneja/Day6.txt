
---------------------GIT-------------------------

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Some Basic Comands--
1)git init ( to initialize a git repository)
2)git pull (Taking code from a repository)
3)git push (Pushing code into a repository)
4)git add  (adding changes to stage area)
5)git commit (Commiting changes)
6)git clone  (cloning form a repository) 

*******************Create a repo on github*************************** 
	
	Create a folder on your system 
		git init
		git pull the link of the repository from github 
			-> see readme.md in current directory
	modify readme.md 
		git commit -a -m message
		git remote add demo the link of the repository from github 
		git push --set-upstream demo master
		
Using Remote add we are linking local repository to the remote repository. And When we make any changes in Local Reposioty 
then we commit it and Push it on to the remote repository.

**************************Maven**************************************

Maven is an automation and management tool. It is written in Java Language and used to build and manage projects .
To configure the Maven, you need to use Project Object Model, which is stored in a pom


Their are different goals while running mvn proj and can export as a executable jar file with others for further use.
Goals:
1)clean
2)package
3)compile
4)test compile
5)test
6)compile
7)install
8)deploy

All dependency are stored in jar File and it will be found in .m2 folder of users.
We can download any dependencies from mvn central repository with the help of pom file.
