--------------AWS---------------

For Paas We make EC2 server instance and there we install node.js application and We try  printing Hello World on the server using AWS 

Next we make some auto scaling groups and check how the instances get scaled up or down according to the number of request that are coming .
We add 1 instance when the Network In goes greater than 10,000 / minute  and We remove 1 instance when Network In goes less than 2000 /Minute .

Now As we were working on more than One server so We also added a Load Balancer which is used to distribute load equally on the servers .
It used the round robin format to send the request to the servers.
