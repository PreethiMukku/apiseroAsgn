-----------------DevOps---------------------

*DevOps=Development + operations
Developer---> deployment--->testing

*DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops)
*It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality
*DevOps is complementary with Agile software development
*Several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology

*Tools of DevOps:
	1.Github
	2.Docker etc.
	
	
ISSUE TRACKING:
While developing some system one can come accross many issues which can be solved by iteration phase and by prioritizing for the same.
Eg: JIRA

---------------AGILE AND ITS METHODOLOGY---------------------------

The meaning of agile is the ability to move quickly and easily.
Agile works on project which needs faster execution and feedback mechanism.
Also agile provides you to change any requirement after its completion also.
Agile is a iterative process.
 
METHODOLOGY:
	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	Working software over comprehensive documentation
	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	Responding to change over following a plan

Agile process flow:
	1.Requirement analysis
	2.design
	3.development
	4.quality assuarance
	5.deployment
	
---------------------------------------------USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING-------------------------------
User acceptance testing (UAT) is done at the end user to check  is particular product is working according to given requirements or not.
Also if we study User acceptance testing before developement phase then will get some idea in advance  about on what basis they are gonna test that particular product.

- Why important?
	- The UAT checks whether the system meets all requirements specified by user and business scenarios.
	   The UAT is the last stage of testing information system. Person responsible for UAT: UAT is the last phase; hence,
	   the testing is performed by end-users and some project analysts.


JIRA is a platform which helps to track and solve issue associated with any code,so also known as Issue tracker.
