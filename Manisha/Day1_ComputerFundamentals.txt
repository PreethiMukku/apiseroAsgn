---------TYPES OF CLIENTS 
Rich Client:
	Platform dependent (in terms of OS, RAM, storage) like notepad++ for windows and oracle for linux,window,solaris
	Run on client side
	No dependency on server
	Client expectations are high (CPU / Storage / RAM)
  New version comes we need to download and install everytime
	Notepad++, eclipse

Thin Client (Browser + Network) 
	Runs on server side
	No Client expectations (CPU / Storage / RAM)
  No platform dependency
  Hacker/online file convertors
	Easy Maintaibility ( code change/versions/patches )
	Round Trip done for fetching Server Resources like when we put email and password valid or invalid it hots the server evertime to cross check whether email is valid or not.
  Denial of service attack
	
RIA (Rich Internet Applications)(Browser + Network)
	Thin Client + Rich clients
	 Asynchorunlsy hots server and  do few things. (Speed, RoundTrips)

Mobile Applications

	Storage/RAM/Processing of client
	download + install (versioning / patches / maintainability )
	Good Interface compared to pure thin client
	Internet connectivity requirements depends on apps Offline/Online/Hybrid options
