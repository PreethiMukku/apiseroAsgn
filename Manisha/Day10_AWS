--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CLOUD COMPUTING------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-It enables users to access same files and applications from  any device.
-Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. 
-Users and companies don't have to manage physical servers.

-ex:
 machine ---> server(3)
            load balancer (1)

client------>load balancer(IP)-------> s1,s2,s3 (server)
purchasing all these machines ---> service
           - service-pay/usage
           - cost
           - Maintenance,configuration,hardware and software support.
- 5 characteristics of cloud computing:  
    1) On-demand self-services: CC services does not require any human interaction. Whenever use wants he can craete their own service or machine.
    2) Broad network access: In this resources are available on cloud and it can be accessed from anywhere by pc,mobile.
    3) Rapid elasticity: The resources allocation must be elastic based on the requests.Scale up and Scale down according to user request.
    4) Resource pooling: The IT resource(networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) present are shared across multiple application.
    5) Measured service: TThe user should be able to use a specified amount of the service from the service provider and be able to prove it according to pay per usage.

#IAAS: Infrastructure as a service
      - In this case the service provider offers services of network, storage, servers, virtualization and asks the operating system the user wants to work on.
      -  The activities of installing the middleware, using the data and configuring a application is completely done by the user
      - Create service and anyone can access this.
      - no load balancer.
      - taken machine from amazon and create own application on machine.
      - service provider provides storage(hdd)/processing(server)/network
      - EX--> Amazon ec2 instance-> download my sql installable, installl it,AZURE

#PAAS: Platform as a service
      - Along with Machine instance, also the middlewares and runtimes are provided where we can use those to have our own application. 
      - AWS - MySQL installed and Configured and longtime maintenance --> RDS
			   AWS - RDS 

#SAAS: Software as a service
       - The instance machines, resources, middleware and runtime everytime and we can directly use the software as a service
	     - SAAS - IAAS + PAAS + software -> just configure and use it
       - Google drive ,office 360,cisco webex, zoom
       
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AUTOSCALING----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Created EC2 instance on AWS whcih act as IaaS----> Then Node js application was installed and run on our own---->Using the code we displayed "Hello World" message on the server----->When the instance was terminated, the server went down.
 - Allows you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions given.
 - AutoScailing is good when load is known.
 - Reintialize the instance if instance get killed or crashed.
 - Minimum value: minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group
 - Maximum value: maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group
 - Desired capacity: no of instance present within defined min and max range
 - Scale up: add instances automatically for max limit -----> MIN=1, MAX=5
 -Scale down: decrease instances -->min=2
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LOAD BALANCING-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Client ----------connects -----> Load Balance -------> EC2
- Client directly connects to lb and lb connecto EC2 server (Tomcat).
-  lb-------->Round robin (s1,s2)
   lb server load equally using round robin algorithm.
- We use LB and autoscaling both together.So that instances which are initialized by autoscaling in case of heavy traffic/mentioned condition those can actually be used for load distribution by load balancer.
   client------>LB-------->(AutoScailing) (Target group)
   AutoScailing is basically good when load is known.
 -DNS Mapping Can also be done by AWS to hide the approach(LIKE sUSAGE OF LOAD BALANCER /SERVER CHANGED) from the end user. 
 - Developmet server
	  Used to develop,test and deploy the projects by the developer.
- Production server
	  Used by the admin to deploy the project from development server at the end.
