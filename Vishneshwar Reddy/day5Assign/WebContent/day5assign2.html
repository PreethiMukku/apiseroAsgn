 	<h2>Java Script:</h2>
 	<p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p><br>
	<h2>Client-Side Java Script:</h2>
	<p style="border-left:7px solid blue; background-color: pink">
		Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.<br>
		The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.<br>
		JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
	</p><br>
	<h2>XML:</h2>
	<p>
		XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is a text-based markup language derived from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).<br>
		XML tags identify the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display the data. XML is not going to replace HTML in the near future, but it introduces new possibilities by adopting many successful features of HTML.
	</p><br>
	<h2>XML Usage:</h2>
	<p>A short list of XML usage says it all:-</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>XML can work behind the scene to simplify the creation of HTML documents for large web sites.</li>
        <li>XML can be used to exchange the information between organizations and systems.</li>
        <li>XML can be used for offloading and reloading of databases.</li>
        <li>XML can be used to store and arrange the data, which can customize your data handling needs.</li>
        <li>XML can easily be merged with style sheets to create almost any desired output.</li>
        <li>Virtually, any type of data can be expressed as an XML document.</li>
	</ul><br>
	<h2>JSON:</h2>
	<p>JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. 
	Conventions used by JSON are known to programmers, which include C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, etc.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.</li>
        <li>The format was specified by Douglas Crockford.</li>
        <li>It was designed for human-readable data interchange.</li>
        <li>It has been extended from the JavaScript scripting language.</li>
        <li>The filename extension is .json.</li>
        <li>JSON Internet Media type is application/json.</li>
        <li>The Uniform Type Identifier is public.json.</li>
	</ul><br>
	<h2>Uses of JSON:</h2>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>It is used while writing JavaScript based applications that includes browser extensions and websites.</li>
        <li>JSON format is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over network connection.</li>
        <li>It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and web applications.</li>
        <li>Web services and APIs use JSON format to provide public data.</li>
        <li>It can be used with modern programming languages.</li>
	</ul><br>
	<h2>Characteristics of JSON:</h2>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>JSON is easy to read and write.</li>
        <li>It is a lightweight text-based interchange format.</li>
        <li>JSON is language independent.</li>
	</ul>
