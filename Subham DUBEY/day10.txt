----------Cloud Overview--------------

- Cloud is providing services to the companies in terms of resources and machines without direct active management of the user.

- Why Cloud is required?
-> The initial investment of setting up and procuring the resources would be very high for the industry. Availing the cloud services would rather be cheaper.
-> Lesser time is required to install and deploy the cloud services.
-> The management of the resources would not be a major concern for the user.

-The 5 essential characters of cloud
1. On demand self services -> The services should on the machine should be that of user. There should be least human interaction when new resources has to be installed.
2. Broad network access -> The service should be accessed from anywhere and on any device like PC, laptop, mobile.
3. Resource pooling -> This checks the resource providers capacity. It determines how much more resources the resourcer can provide.
4. Rapid elasticity -> The resourcer should be able to scale up or scale down the resources according to the demand of the user.
5. Measured services -> The user should be able to use a specified amount of the service from the service provider and be able to prove it.

- Cloud as a Service
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) -> In this case the service provider offers services of network, storage, servers, virtualization and asks the operating system the user wants to work on.
                                 The activities of installing the middleware, using the data and configuring a application is completely done by the user. Ex: AWS EC2 instance.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) -> In PaaS, The user is availed additional services of middleware and runtime apart from all the services provided by the IaaS. This basically means that the user 
                                 has to use the middleware provided as service to come up with an application. Ex: AWS RDS.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS) -> Here, SaaS is combination of IaaS, PaaS and Software. The user has everything ready. He/She has to only customize the application according to their requirement.
                                 Ex: Online compilers, Office 365, Google Suite.
          
-Demo          

-> The first demo was done on Infrastructure as a Service where we created a EC2 instance on AWS whcih provided as the requisites as IaaS in Windows OS. Node js application was installed and run on our own.
   Using the code we displayed "Hello World" message on the server. However when the instance was terminated, the server went down.
   
-> Then we revisted the demo on Platform as a Service were RDS was initially created on day 6.

-> Then we had a demo on scaling the servers up an down by setting the scaling parameters. The scaling parameters were sent such that if there was more than 10000 requests in a minute on the host 1, a new server is launched.
  If the requests is less than 2000 per minute, a server is removed. Here even if the instance is terminated, the server shows the output since the minimum, desired and  maximum number of servers is fixed.

-> In the next demo, we launched a load balancer in the instance after creating two servers. It used the round robin format to send the request to the servers.

-> The last demo was creating an instance with both auto scaling and load balancer.
