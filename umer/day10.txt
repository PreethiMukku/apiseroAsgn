-> Cloud computing 
- delivery of on demand computing services -application ,storage ,processing
- pay as per you go basis
- rather than owning our own data centers we can rent anything from the cloud service provider

- benifit
- we dont need to maintain the infrastructure
- pay for what we use

->characteristics
 - on demand self service
 - broader network access
 - resource pooling 
 - rapid elasricity
 - measured services.

-> Types of cloud service
  1. Infrastructure as a Service(IAAS)-virtualization ,servers, storage networking
  2. Platform as a service (PAAS)-runtime environment,middleware,os,virtualization ,servers, storage networking
  3. Software as a service (SAAS)- application ,Data, runtime environment,middleware,os,virtualization ,servers, storage networking

-> AMAZON WEB SERVICES (AWS)
  - Amazon web service is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions.
  - AWS is a comprehensive, easy to use computing platform offered Amazon. 
  - The platform is developed with a combination of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.

->  The AWS global infrastructure is massive and is divided into geographical regions. 
    The geographical regions are then divided into separate availability zones. While selecting the geographical regions for AWS three factors come into play 
   - Optimizing Latency 
   - Reducing cost 
   - Government regulations (Some services are not available for some regions).

  Each region is divided into at least two availability zones that are physically isolated from each other. 
  This provides business continuity for the infrastructure as in a distributed system if one zone fails to function the infrastructure in other availability zones remain operational. 
  The largest region North-Virginia (US-East) has six availability zones. These availability zones are connected by high-speed fiber-optic networking.

-> Amazon EC2 Instance
  An EC2 instance is nothing but a virtual server in Amazon Web services terminology. It stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. 
  It is a web service where an AWS subscriber can request and provision a compute server in AWS cloud.
  An on-demand EC2 instance is an offering from AWS where the subscriber/user can rent the virtual server per hour and use it to deploy his/her own applications.

-> Auto Scaling group
  An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. 
  An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies.
  Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.
  The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.
