-> VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS
  - Software that allows us to keep the track of the changes made to the file and revert back to
    any particular change that we wish.

-> Repository
  - place where all files are stored
  - It  contains full history of the project
  - can be local or remote
  

-> Types of version control systems
 -> Centralized version control system
  - Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files and enables team collaboration. 
  - It works on a single repository to which users can directly access a central server.
  - Every programmer can extract or "update" their workstations with the data present in the repository or can make changes to the data or "commit" in the repository. 
 -> Distributed version control system 
  - These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project file.

  - In Distributed VCS, every contributor has a local copy or “clone” of the main repository 
    i.e. everyone maintains a local repository of their own which contains all the files and metadata present in the main repository.

  - They can update their local repositories with new data from the central server by an operation called “pull” 
    and affect changes to the main repository by an operation called “push” from their local repository.

  - You commit
  - You push
  - They pull
  - They update
  - popular distributed version control systems are Git, Mercurial.


-> Lab1

	Create a repo on github (tmpdemo)
	
	Create a folder on your system (anyname -> tmp11)
		git init
		git pull https://github.com/umerbeigh/tmpdemo master
			-> see readme.md in current directory
	modify readme.md 
		git commit -a -m message
		git remote add mynm https://github.com/umerbeigh/tmpdemo
		git push --set-upstream mynm master

---------------

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/umerbeigh/tmp.git
git push -u origin master
------------------
	
	
Lab 2-  
	For clone
	just create a tmp directory 
	in >git clone https://github.com/umerbeigh/apisero  
	change files
	>git commit
