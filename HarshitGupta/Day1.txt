Types of Clients
 	Rich Client
	 ---A lot depends on the client's hardware,No server dependency,Updates needs to be reinstalled
Thin Clients
---No Hardware requirement from the Client,Server dependent hence time to fetch data is more,Updates need not be done by the client,No OS dependency
RIA
---Uses async calls in the background,Same features as Thin Client
Mobile Applications
---- Needs to be developed for different Platforms,Requires hardware on the client side,Updates needs to be downloaded,Apps can be online offline or of Hybrid type.Example of offline is Calculator,Online being GPay and Hybrid being Paytm
Different Orientations
Procedure Oriented
--Here a lot of importance is given to the order in which it is executed,No importance is given to data Example C
Object Oriented
--Here mostly every thing is in the form of object and Data is given the most priority.Example Java
Component Oriented

Service Oriented
Here we use different services which are already existing so as to reduce the time to redevelop the same code.Different services can be used through APIs .Example Mulesoft
Different Types of Languages
	Compiled
Here a compiler is used where it converts the code into machine language before executing and alerts if any error in the code during compile time only.
Scripting
Here the code is not complied before execution bt an interpreter is used and directly interpreted during runtime and excecuted
Application Changes
Fast modifications
--The developed application must be able to adapt to fast changes if required so as to cope up the user requirements
Common code with multiple Interfaces
---
Need of Integration with different applications   
--If we use different services we must keep in mind the formats from the different serives and integrate in such a way that the appication is scalable
