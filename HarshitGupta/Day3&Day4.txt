Java-
-Source code->Compiler(javac)-> .class (Byte code) -> java -> Machine code.
-java allows maximum compile time exceptions.
-Provides various classes and default keywords and libraries.
-Platform independent as there are different JREs for different OS.
-JRE is required on the platforms to run the byte code(.class file).

Naming Conventions in Java
-Class name should start with Capital letter.
-file name should be same as Public class name.So this means in one java file there can be only one public class
-All similar funtionalities doing clases should be inside one package

Abstract Class->
-Abstract classes used for 1. Inheritance 2. Static
-It can have non abstract methods too.
-Cannot create instance of Abstract class but still one can write its constructor.
-Can create derived class from Abstract Class and the derived class must override all abstract methods.

Abstract Method->
-Abstract method should be declared in Abstract class only.
-These methods cant be final and must be implemented by the derived class

Final Class->
-defining a class final one cant extend it..This is one when we want the funtionalites to be use only and oe cant override and change the methods of this class
Final Method->
-Final method cannot be overridden in derived class.

Interface in java->
-One Interface can implement another interface.
-no actual methods but only abstract methods.
-Interfaces can have static final variables
-One class can implement multiple interfaces and if one class implements an interface then all abstract methods must be defined
-One interface can implement another interface

Constructors in Java->
-If constructor is not mentioned, java creates default constructor.
-For inheritance, java initiates constructor of base class first and then derived class constructor.
-Constructors used for Object Initialization.

Access Modifiers in Java->
-Public:Accessible from anywhere
-Private:can be accessible only from the same class
-Protected.Can be accessible in the same class and any derived class from different package too
-Default:if no modifier not specified then this is used by default.It can be accessible from the package only.

Exception Handling in java->
-Try block contains the code which may cause exception.
-Catch block catches the exception occured in try 
-There can be multiple catch blocks
catch(Exception e)
{
throw e;
}
and throws it to client with Exception message. throw e.
-finally is a block in Java, it executes anyway.
-examples-> IndexOutOfBoundException, ArithmeticException,NullPointerException, etc.

Collection Frameworks in Java->
-Combination of interface, implementation and Algorithms.
-can be set, list and map.

-List is an interface and java defines its implementation as ArrayList , LinkedList etc
-List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

-For set interface , there are many classes such as HashSet, TreeSet already implemented.
-HashSet->
  1.There are no duplications
  2.Has no ordering or can say has hash function ordering
  3.Set<Integer> h1  = new HashSet<>();
-TreeSet->
  1. There are no duplications
  2. has proper ordering, elements are sorted.
  3.Set<Integer> h1  = new TreeSet<>();

-Map is something which comes with Key Value Pair.
-For map interface, there are classes like HashMap, TreeMap
-HashMap->
    1.Map<String,Integer> map =new HashMap<>();
    2. Has functions such as put,remove,get.
    3.The key value pair is sorted accordint t0 the hashing logic
-TreeMap->
    1.Map<String,Integer> map =new TreeMap<>();
    2. Has functions such as put,remove,get.
    3.Keys are sorted in ascending order by default

-MultiThreading in java->
-Multithreading is spliting work task into threads assigning each with equal amount of time.
-implemented by extending Thread class or implementing the Runnable imterface.
-Have to override run() method.
-In main method have to create object of thread and can call start() method.
