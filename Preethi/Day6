Day 6 - RDBMS/SQL	

RDBMS
   RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System
   Based on relational model
   Basis for Sql
   Data is stored in tables(collection of data entries)
   Table = rows + columns
   provides vertical distribution of data
   Keys:
	Primary key -> Doesn't allow duplicates or null values
		    -> Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table
	Foreign key -> refers to another table in database
		    -> Uniquely identifies each row/record in any another table in database 
   Normalization: 
	efficient organizing of data
	Avoids redundancy and anamolies

   Database Server/Client
	Sql and NoSql
        	
    Relationship in tables
        one-one
        one-many
        many-many

    Fetching data from multiple tables
        Joins: 
	   Used in joining of tables based on commom column in both tables
	   Inner join, Left join, Right join, Full join, Self join and Cartesian product
	Union:
	   Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements without returning any duplicate rows
	   Two tables must have same number of columns
	   Same number of column expressions
	   The same data type and
	   Have them in the same order
