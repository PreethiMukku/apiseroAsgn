 V-model

 Agile Development: https://agilemanifesto.org/
 Agile model: feedback kind of model
   Discover->Design->Develop->Test => Repeat at every stage
 Agile manifesto: 
  "Individuals and interactions" over processes and tools
  "Working software" over comprehensive documentation
  "Customer collaboration" over contract negotiation
  "Responding to change" over following a plan
 Agile principles
 Agile tools -> Jira agile, Agile workbench etc..
 Spiral vs Agile
   -> In agile at every phase we deliver the working software model to the customer
   -> In spiral the delivery happens after the end of all phases
 When to use agile and when not to use

UAT -> User Acceptance Testing
	Product end-user does UAT -> Beta programs
	It is different from customer feedback, UAT is done in every development phase
	UAT should occur early and often
	Shouldn't focus on bugs or deffects
	Communicate feedback 
Jira 
  Bug and issue tracker
  Issue tracker, Reports, Dashboards
  Issue types -> Bug, Feature, Task, Improvement
