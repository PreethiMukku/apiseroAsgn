Communication b/w microservices -> Rest client is used
Flow of microservices

Cloud computing -> provides computation power
Cloud services -> provides services through internet, No dependency on client architecture
  -> Features
	-> on demand self services -> high availability of services at any time to use on our own
				   -> No other person interaction should be required for using services
 	-> Broad network access -> mobile, laptop
 	-> Resource pooling -> Availability of certain(necessary) resources(collection of services) to use at any point of time
	-> Rapid elasticity -> able to do scale up(increase) and scale down(decrease) immediatly
	-> Measured services -> measure the usage of services and prove that a certain amount of services are used
			     -> Pay for only used services

Huge hardware --> Virtualization --> Not presented physicially
Middleware -> any tools/ service providers -> eclipse etc.

Cloud services
  -> IAAS Infrastructure as a service
	Storage/ Processing/ Network 
	-> AWS(EC2) -> download, install and configure mysql
  -> PAAS Platfrm as a service
	OS, installatons and configurations 
	eg: online compiler
	-> AWS(RDS) -> MySql already installed and configured 
  -> SAAS Software as a service
	Iaas + Paas + software
	Only configuration is done by user to use it
	No ownership on application
	Eg: Google apps(Google drive), zoom, Office 365
	Advantages:
		Least cost
		Flexibility to use it from any where (no fixed position)
		Service provider takes care of updations and maintainance
	Cons: 
		Tightly coupled Eg: migrating from google forms to suvey monkey forms we have to create evrything from scratch
AWS:
  -> ec2 -> elastic compute cloud
	provides scalable computing capacity
  	1)fully automated scalling 2) scheduled scalling 3) manual scalling
  -> create a server instance 
	instance types-> configure instance type-> storage type etc..
  -> configure instance
	location, zone, tenacity...
  -> security configuration should be done

  Scaling up/down:
	Auto scalling -> create a scalling policy -> configure it (create cloud alarm)

  Load balancer   
	create->configure->configure security group->configure routing->Register target group
