SOA:
  -> Service oriented architecture
  -> Provides services to clients
  -> Doesn't depend on client architecture
  -> SOAP based services -> any protocol + Xml data format
  -> Rest based services -> Http protocol + any format(Json prefered)

SOAP:
  ->SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
  ->Requests are not tightly coupled, can work with any protocols
  ->Http get/post are the only protocols supported in SOAP
  ->Can use any protocol
  ->Can only work with XML format
  ->Requires more bandwidth, Since SOAP Messages contain a lot of information

REST:
  ->REST stands for Representational State Transfer
  ->Tightly coupled with Http protocol
  ->Does not need much bandwidth when requests are sent to the server. REST messages mostly just consist of JSON messages
  ->REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON, etc. Preferred format  is JSON

Testing:
  Behaviour driven development (BDD):
	Document oriented
	Requirements are gathered and functionalities are defined first
  Test driven development (TDD):
	Test cases are designed first
	Bsed on test cases functionality is developed
	Reduces development time 
	-> unit testing
	-> integration testing

Rich client testing -> JUnit(Java applications)
Thin client testing -> Unit testing(functionality)
		       Web UI testing
Rest API -> Postman
Http methods -> GET -> gives data
		POST -> creates entity
		PUT -> updates entity
		DELETE -> deletes entity

Code coverage -> amount of code covered in testing
Test coverage -> No.of features covered in testing
