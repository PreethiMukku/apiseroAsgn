Day 7 – IDE Eclipse, Github, Maven
	
    Version Control 
	Records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
	-> Local version control system
	-> centralized system
		Contain just one repository(remote repository) and each user gets their own working copy
	-> Distributed system
		Contain multiple repositories. Each user has their own repository(Local repository) and working copy
		
  
    Initialization of repository -> git init
    Clone -> gives a copy of repository
    Checking in -> git pull
    Checking out -> git push

    Maven	
	Project management and version&control that is based on POM
	It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.
    	A maven repository is a directory of packaged JAR file with pom.xml file
	Maven local repository is located in local system and created by the maven when we run any maven command.
	  -> By default, maven local repository is ".m2" directory.
	Maven central repository is located on the web, created by the apache maven community
	  -> contains a lot of common libraries 

	POM is an acronym for Project Object Model. 
	pom.xml file contains information of project and configuration information to build the project
	Maven Goals:
		Clean - removes target folder created by previous build
		Compile - Compiles the source code using JDK dependencies
		Test - Runs unit tests
		Package - Converts the application into JAR file, by default compiles the code. 
		Install - Installs the package
