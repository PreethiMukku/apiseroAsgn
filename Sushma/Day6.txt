- Outer Join:
	- Left Join: returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table 
	Ex: SELECT d.deptno, count(e.ename) from dept d LEFT JOIN emp e ON e.deptno = d.deptno GROUP BY e.deptno;
	
	- Right Join: returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table
	Ex: SELECT e.ename from emp RIGHT JOIN dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno ORDER BY d.deptno;
	
Union:
- Used to combine the result set of two or more 'Select' statements
