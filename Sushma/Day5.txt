Day 5



Web Programming:

Rich client: 
- Java-> main()
- Class --> java Lab1
- Lab1.class
- JRE Installed
- Processing (CPU/Storage/RAM)

Mixed mode in command prompt: 
- Compiled and Interpreted, where the code changed to native.

Thin Client (Web Applications):
Client   -----------------> Server(Web Server)
(Browser)		             t1.html(Servlet/JSP)

cmd> ping abc.com
- tells the IP address
- DNS service is running which can map to host IP address
- Default port is 8080 (in Java)
- DNS service (Host -> IP Address)


               html
Browser <------------------  Server 
							t1.html (Consider this as static content - alomost like news paper site)

HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language (Most commonly used to rendered the data)

Three types of languages:
- Compile Language
- Interpreted Language
- Markup Language

Microsoft's most popular server is IIS

Java 
- Tomcat (Webserver + Java code on server side)
- JBOSS
- WebLogic

- We have to write the code in Java, gets extra libraries fom servlet/JSP
- Code written on Eclipse and deployed on Tomcat

Javascript: 
- It is executed on the browser
- Simple validation
- String, minlength
- Not null 
- All these are executed on the browser side

Rich Internet Application:
- Main business logic is on server side
- HTML + Javascript + CSS
- Calling externally should have unique IP address

HTML has 2 things 
- <Head> and 
- <Body>

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):
- It is a simple mechanism for adding style (fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents
- Real sites usees common bunch of CSS

Externalization:
- stands for writing complete script, we will split in another file to write Javascript

Format of data:
Client  <--------------  Server
		  HTML+Js+CSS
		  
Popular formats: 
- XML (Extensible markup language) - used for Business to Business purpose
- Has (n+1) problem - Too much of data to exchange is bothering
- Takes more storage
- Time consumption

After XML, Json format came into existence
- Json doesnt required to write even a single piece of code
- Java Script Object Notation

Client Side:
- Work with HTML, Javascript, XML/Json, CSS
