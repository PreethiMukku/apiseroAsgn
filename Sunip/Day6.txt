Day 6:- SQL and DBMS 

Types of Relationships:
1)one-one: Such a relationship exists when each record of one table is related to only one record of the other table.Ex : Person and Passport
2) one-many:Such a relationship exists when each record of one table can be related to one or more than one record of the other table. This relationship is the most common relationship found. A one-to-many relationship can also be said as a many-to-one relationship depending upon the way we view it.

      
3)many-many:Such a relationship exists when each record of the first table can be related to one or more than one record of the second table and a single record of the second table can be related to one or more than one record of the first table.
Example Product and Customer

RDMS: Relational Database Management System
	--> A relational database refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.
	--> This makes it easy to locate and access specific values within the database.
	--> It is relational because the values within each table are related to each other.
	--> Tables may also be related to other tables.
	--> The relational structure makes it possible to run queries across multiple tables at once.
		Ex:--> Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.

Database Server:
	--> A database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers.
	--> Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-->server functionality.
	--> Some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the clientâ€“server model for database access.
	
CRUD Operations in Database:
	Create --> Used to insert row to table
	Read --> Used to retrieve data from table
	Update --> Used to edit rows in a table.
	Delete --> Used to delete rows in a table.

		--> Right Join

			The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.
			
		--> Full Join
