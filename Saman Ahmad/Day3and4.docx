--------------------------------DAY 3 & 4--------------------------------------

FUNDAMENTALS JAVA
 
Compiler(JDK)-1.8 (OS/ Architecture Dependent)
Runtime (JRE)
Pure object Oriented Language
not so many keywords rather maximum library provided to programmers.
Platform Independent
Program first compiled by a compiler i.e source code->.class file(Byte code)
Byte code can be executed on any platform provided it has JRE installed in it.⦁	
Byte code is finally interpreted by JVM to convert into machine code.

Package
Classes grouped into packages.
Package should follow the folder hierarchy
Instead of new functions , syntax==>> New package/library

Java.lang, java.util--->> packages(JAVA Standard Edition, SE). 
Javax.  --> Java Enterprise Edition EE.


Java 8 (Oracle supported)API Documentation should be referred for any function, class, library, interface or language related syntax, keywords etc.
 
 we need import library  in our project using import statement.
      Eg. import java.util, import java.sql,
Java.lang.System  --> No need to import, everything Ithis auto imported.

Compilation and running of a Java program via cmd.

Eclipse:
 Same file - any number of class.
  Ctrl+space--> auto import of respective libraries.
  
Naming Conventions:
Class name should start with Capital letter.
file name should be same as Public class name.
method name- start with small letter(camel case syntax)
Variables same as type of the variable in small case .


javac -s. calc.java--> source file
javac -d.calc.java---> crete folder first then .java(destination).


Every class extend frpm object class.
Array.toString [1,3,3,5,7] convert array to string
String str=Array.toString [1,3,3,5,7] 

Null pointer Exception 
In Java, a special null value can be assigned to an object reference. NullPointerException is thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference that has the null value


Getter Setter funtion
 Getters and setters are used to protect data
 getter method returns its value while a setter method sets or updates its value

ACCESS MODIFIERS
    
	Same class	Subclass within package	Not a subclass	Sublass in diff package	Different package

-Default	YES	YES	YES	NO	NO
-Private	YES	NO	YES	NO	NO
Protected	YES	YES	YES	YES	NO
-Publlic	YES	YES	YES	YES	YES



@Override
 overriding of methods 

Abstract classes
Cannot create instance of Abstract class.
Can not be used in inheritance.

Abstract Method donot have defination, is called in subclass 
Abstract method should be declared in Abstract class only.


Final Class
Can create instance of Abstract class.
Cannot create derived class from Abstract Class.


Final Method
cannot be overridden in subclass.

One Java Class cannot extend multiple Java classes.

Interface 
 pure abstraction.
One Interface can extend one or more interfaces.
Contains no data variables, no method defination but only abstract methods.

Constructors
Java creates default constructor for every class.
java initiates constructor of base class first and then of derived class constructor.
2 TYPES : Default, Parametrised
Constructors used for Object Initialization.

Array	
collection of same datatypes
 its length is fixed and need to be stated at the time of creation.
if arraytype is object then default is NULL is stored reference address.

Exception Handling 

TRY, CATCH, Finally

Try block contains the code which may cause exception.
Catch block catches the exception occured in try block and throws it t with Exception message. 
finally is a block in Java, it executes anyway.

Collection Frameworks 
Combination of interface, implementation and Algorithms.
can be set, list and map.

Arraylist
	Collection of item, 
same elements allowed	, 
Ordering/sorting(FCFS)


List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
	list.add("AA");
	list.remove(1);
	System.out.println(list);
	list.set(1,"22222222222");
	System.out.println(list);

HashSet 
Collection of items that uses a hash table for storage
No copy of elements allowed.
Ordering/sorting OF Elements internally

Set<Integer> l2  = new HashSet<>();
	l2.add(11);// convert int to Integer -> Boxing 
	System.out.println("hashset:   "+l1);

HashMap
Store items in key/value pairs, 
Duplicates not excepted
	Ordering/sorting OF Elements internally


Map<String,Integer> map =new TreeMap<>();
		map.put("RAM", 60);
				System.out.println(map);
	
MultiThreading 
spliting work  into threads assigning each with equal amount of time.
Time slicing 
extend Thread class.
 create object of thread and can call start() , run(), sleep() ,methods
class overrides the run() method available in the Thread class.
 start() --method to start the execution of a thread..
 Run()--A thread begins with run() method. 
sleep()--Causes the recently executing thread to sleep(stop executing ) for the specified number of milliseconds
