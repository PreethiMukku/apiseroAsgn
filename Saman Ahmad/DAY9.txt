-----------------------------------------Basic Infrastructure Server/Cluster/LB---------------------------------


An N-Tier Application program is one that is distributed among three or more separate computers in a distributed network.

The most common form of n-tier is the 3-tier Application, and it is classified into three categories
3 Tier Architecture:  Application there are three tiers like Presentation Layer , Application Layer and Data layer.
   			 Here the application layer contains business logic as well .

layering:
Browser--------------->servelet/JSP------------------JAVA file for DB comm -------------DB 
                  HTML(form)                      Buisiness logic                    Persistance logic
                  (presentation logic)
 
 CRAWLERS: used by search engines to collect data from the internet. check the content over net with search query.


--------------------------HOSTING-------------------------
Single Server Hosting:
	less network calls.
	Small code size
	Uses no 3rd party services.
	less load 

Distributed Server Hosting:
	network calls are many.
	Large code size.
	Uses many 3rd party services.
	load may be unpredictable at times.


DOWN TIME:

browser---------------------------------------------------------------------server site

http://abc.com
10:40 pm-------5mins(Down time)
10:45 pm

Downtime: the proportion of a time-span that a system is unavailable or offline.
 
to avoid the downtime:  use multiple servers to serve the request,

1)request first goto server 1, if server1 not unavailable/crash, the request goes to server2.
  Active- passive approach. i.e at a time only one server is active and other one is passive/inactive, and only when it is not able to handle requests, 
  it send the request to other one. 
	
	FAILOVER: is the ability to seamlessly and automatically switch to a reliable backup system.
		A redundant or standby database server, system, or other hardware component, server, or network 
		should be ready to replace any previously active version upon its abnormal termination or failure

2) the servers to share load.
                                                                 server1(10.10.10.20) SPOF(single Point of failure)
   http://abc.com --------------------------LOAD BALANCER--------
                                                                 server2(10.10.10.21) 
SPOF(single Point of failure): is a point in a system where any failure accurs , it will stop the entire system from working. 

LoadBalancer: It is used to manage the requests coming from the client and redirect it between the servers to distribute the load. 
		The URL is given the LoadBalancer's IP. So request is sent to LB first, and usually it distributes the load between the servers in a round robin fashion.

Clusters: a cluster is a group of servers and other resources that act like a single system and enable high availability and, in some cases, load balancing 
          and parallel processing.
	 if we modify a file, we need to deploy our app in any of the server in a cluster, and all the other servers maintains the same copy of the file. 


---------------------------------------------Monolithic and Microservices-------------------------------
Monolithic:
	 monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform.
	A monolithic application is self-contained, and independent from other computing applications. 


Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application 
		as a collection of services that are

		Highly maintainable and testable
		Loosely coupled
		Independently deployable
		Organized around business capabilities	
		Owned by a small team
	The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications.
	It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.


Scalability: same performance in all conditions i.e irrespective of load applied, it should performs well.
		eg: whatsapp grop feature that increased its capacity from 56 to 200.
