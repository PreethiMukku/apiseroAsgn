         ---------------------------------------PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS---------------------------------------------------
  
OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING(OOP):programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions 
				and logic.  An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
	Data to be given more importance, 
	avoid modification from outside methods and functions
	local variables should be private
	only the member functions should be able to access the variables.

class-  holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
object- instances of classes
method- behaviour


							________________________OOPS CONCEPTS:_____________________________



ABSTRACTION:    hidding background/ internal implementation details from the user.
		in java Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.
		 eg: Washing Machine

ENCAPSULATION:  mechanism of grouping/wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
		eg: Tablets.

INHERITANCE: one class inherit the features(data and/or methods) of another class. there should be some common data (variables or functions)
		two main moto :
		1. code reusability
		2. Type to be same(by interface)

base class-> the class whose properties are being inherited.
sub class/ derived class--> which inherit the property from derived class.
Different types:
simple,multiple,hierarchial,multilevel,hybrid
 

               ***************java does not support multiple inheritance but through********************
Facts:  Java does not support multiple inheritance
	Class can implement interfaces
	Class can extends one class and implement many interfaces
So to avoid ambiguity java donot support multiple inheritance
also as java supports Compile time relationship and avoid run time relationships.

            ********************************Inheritance breaks Encapsulation*********************
partially true and partially false.



POLYMORPHISM:
 		-Poly-many, morph-forms
		Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
IN JAVA acheived by 2 ways:
 
1.method-overloading
  different methods in different class to have the same name, but with different input parameters.
 eg, print(), print(int a), print(int a, int b)
   .
 2.method-overriding
   -functions with same name and same parameter inputs can be within the same or derived class.
