Database
online sources: db-engines, db-fiddle
 Main Feature of Oracle is that its gives support for virtual break/distribution of Databases. 
i.e. a part of DB can be used into operations without the need for calling the entire DB to load into the memory.

RDMS- database in a tabular format. (all entries have same formats/attributes) eg mysql

NoSQL- each document can be different. eg- MongoDB

RDBMS- CRUD operations.

Create: CREATE DATABASE databasename;

Retrieve: SELECT * FROM table_name;

Update: UPDATE Customers
	SET ContactName = 'Amit', City= 'Sam'
	WHERE CustomerID = 1;

Delete operations. DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Sam';


------------------------ Relationship in tables--------------------------
1)one-one: when a single record in the first table is related to only one record in the second table, and a single record in the second table is related to only one 	                    record in the first table

2) one-many:A one-to-many relationship exists between a pair of tables when a single record in the first table can be related to one or more records in the second table, but a 		single record in the second table can be related to only one record in the first table.
      
3)many-many:A pair of tables bears a many-to-many relationship when a single record in the first table can be related to one or more records in the second table and a single 			record in the second table can be related to one or more records in the first table.


-----------------------Constraints---------------------------------
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
	eg :NOT NULL ,UNIQUE ,PRIMARY KEY ,FOREIGN KEY 

We can create our own contraints names for better identification of where the error has occur in query.

-----------------------------SQL JOINS-----------------------------------
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
Different Types of SQL JOINs:
1)(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
	eg.     SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
		FROM Orders
		INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;

2)LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
	eg>	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
		FROM Customers
		LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
		ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
		
3) RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
	eg.	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
		FROM Orders
		RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
		ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;

4)FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
	eg.	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
		FROM Customers
		FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
		ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;



---------------------------------SQL UNION -----------------------------
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

----------eg: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
		UNION ALL
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
