 Day 5 : Web programming :
	
	• Thin client (web applications)
		- Client ----(Network)-------Server(web server)
		Browser<----------html-------t1.html(static content-fixed content)
		Network         https://  = protocol (for every protocol there is diff port
				https://hostaddress = google.com(DNS (Host -> IP Address))
				https://server:8080/ti.html = the client reuest and receivesthis t1 html page.
	• Html 
		- hypertext markup langugage
	• Java -> Tomcat 
		-  webserver+java codeon server side
	• Thin client 
	Github browser ------------github server---storedatabase
	Username,password
	Javascript----validation--modifyting something on client side--(always executedand avauble  on client side browser)
	Google.com(client side code being executed).
	• Your main code has to be on serverand not on client sid.(here server will be tomcate and we will code in eclipse)
	• RIA also uses javascript+HTML.
	• Makehtml file in notepad .save it using.html.check it on server /google.
	• Google---> C:\apisero(location)  ---- open file from system-not recommnded
	• Download tomact --extract it in c->work.
	• You can start and stop any server from bin.
	• We will configure these things throguh eclipse.
	Eclipse->Web_project->sttaic eb proj->project name->target runtime(server on which we will deployed)->simple plain http server ->publich directory->
	• Lab 1:
		- Window->show view->servers->display no server in console-
		- Create a new server.
		- Basic http preview(it wont ask by default it will set anything)->select->finish.
		- Create static web project ->http preview server choose in target runtime.(this I current runtime server)->finish.
		- In that project :  Webcontnen in web project->file new -> index.html ->index.5
		- Give titile and heading
		- Right click on index.html or run 
		- Choose an e xisitng server-http preview->next->finish.
		- Automaitically embedded browser will get openend.
		- But if you want     to test in on external browser then
		Copy url ans paste it external.
	• HTML FORMS :
		- Take input via html forms.
		- Make new html page and call it from old html page.
		- You will see in link that whtever input u are giving is coming there.
		(
		/calling dusra html lage from this page
		<a href="secondhtmlforms.html">Take me to inout html forms page</a>
		)
	• CSS :
		- Deifinig  the style ,color etc as a whole.
		- You can create a css file -stylesheet alag se using new file .
		- Now , you can provide this css sheet link to your html files in head
		Like    <link rel="stylesheet" href="simplecssfile.css">
		- Now you can run it .All your html files where you have inculded the link will have that css stylesheet.
		
	• 404 not fund - stop the server in down area run dusra code.
	• Whenever you find  8080 in use , 
	Do following 
	1. We will find the PID i.e Process Id and then we will kill the process of child process which is using this Port.
        Find PID:Process ID (every process has unique PID) c:user>user_name>netstat -o -n -a | findstr 0.0.8080
		Or just copy the address from right click ->properties and put it in browser.
	• Java script
		- JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.
		- You can aslo write it in separate fie and link it.But we usually  don’t prefer it .
		- Don’t put anything important /bussiness logic on javascript because full code is viisible by end user on client side.
		- Dthere are only 2 cent chances of writing js code as we have many framework,libraries which we can directly use.
	• Format of data 
	• XML : 
		- In html,we can only use the tags provided already.
		- In xml,follows hierarachical structure.
		- In xml,you can make your own structure.
		- Not preferred  because of huge overhead.
		- Only prefer for B2B.
	• JSON : 
		- Javascript object notations.
		- Lots of libraries avalible whenver you want ot ocnvert c->json,java->jsn,js->json,ython->json.
		- This is the advantage of using json.Without writing single piece of code ,I m able to achieve everyhting.

	• Server side code will only be processedon server and not come on client.we set validation for server side.
	Php ,nodejsall are server side code.
	Youwill do evrything in html page.
	
	• Assignmnet:
		- Apisero image.
		- Coloring note
		-  button (next)
		- Next page should have your todays notes.
