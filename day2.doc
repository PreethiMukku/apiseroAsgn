Programming Fundamentals:
Oops Concepts:
Orientation:
- Data is not given due importance
- Too many code snippets can directly change the data
- The two options are Local variables and Global variables

Grouping: Classification of information
- To classify the section into small groups of information
- No modifications of data from outside
- All data members should be private
- All public members should have access to the data

Object:
- Object orientation should be part of the language, code is not object oriented
- Object -> Instance of your class
- Object acts as the medium of communication between two classes
- Object and class has different syntax

Encapsulation:
- It binds one or more instances into one entity
Ex: Laptop, Tablet

Abstraction: 
- External person should know the business logic. It is hidden (Hiding the details from the external users, only outside information is displayed to the     external users)
Ex: Google maps
- Abstraction at various levels happens continuously
- When dont have the body then it is Abstract method

Inheritance:
- Some things need to utilize from the property of the class
- Use inheritance only if something is comman data members or methods
- Super class - Sub class (or) Base class - derived class
- Code reuse - Variables/Code
			 - Data members/member functions
- Type should be same (Interface declaration)

Interface:
- Interface gives the specifications that to be used in the code
- Variables are not declared in interface

Polymorphism:
- Samething multiple forms (One name many forms)
- Method taking multiple forms -> Method Overloading
- Method Overriding

1) Java supports multiple inheritance using interfaces:
	- Fact: Java does not support multiple inheritance
	- Fact: Class can implement interfaces
	- Fact: Class can extends one class and implement many interfaces

2) Inheritance breaks Encapsulation:
	- It could be true or false
