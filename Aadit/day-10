Why Cloud?
Machine -> Servers -> Cluster 
Client ---------------> LB(IP)--------------------> s1,s2,s3
		  Software/Hardware
			Host			3 Quality Machines


1. Purchasing all these machines -> Service
	-> 1. Service - pay/Usage
	-> 2. Cost
	-> 3. Maintain -> Installation, Configuration,H/w and S/w support

Cloud -
Essential characteristics - 
1. On demand self services 
2. Resource Pooling
3. Rapid Elasticity
4. Measured Service
5. Multi Tenacity  

Virtualization - can offer huge hardware/software support. 
	-> Different OS 
	-> Different RAM
In virtualization, you have only one Huge hardware where you virtualize it into small parts
based on the OS and memory you need. 
Most countries have set up this hardware setup. Types of setup:
	-> Regional- within each region you have multiple ZONES
		-> Zones (Minimum 2 zones)

With your device(laptop/desktop) you can connect to any region. 
After connecting you ask for an Instance of the machine
You install dependencies and softwares like MySQL for our need. 

Cloud Servies:
	-> Infrastructure as a Server(IAAS)
		-> Storage(harddisk)-->Processing (server) -> Network
	-> Platform as a Service (PAAS)
		Along with Machine instance, also the middlewares and runtimes are provided where we can use those to have our own application. 
		eg We can have MySQL RDS directly instead of having a machine and then installing and configuring it on our own.
	-> Software as a Service (SAAS)
		The instance machines, resources,middleware and runtime everytime and we can directly use the software as a service.
eg gmail.

AWS - EC2
EC2 instances are created and we have multiple ways to create a Machine image based
on our needs. To make use of the different instances, you need to make sure to set the security rules as well. 
Auto Scaling is one of the main things we discussed today. AWS Auto scaling allows you to create multiple instances. 
It will ask you to define minimum,maximum and desired capacity. 
So let's say you are told to make minimum capacity as 1, desired capacity as 1 and maximum as 5. 
AWS monitors the requests coming to our server and lets say that requests are normal, it only initializes single 
EC2 instance
