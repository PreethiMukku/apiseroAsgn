-->What is RDBMS
- Relational Database Management System refers to database having tabular structure. 
- The structure of the DB is created as a combination of columns and rows. The columns of the table represent different attributes of an entity
while the rows represent different records with resepct to that relation. 
- RDBMS is one of the traditional and most commmonly used data saving architectures.
- To make use of the RDMS, we have different frameworks having different features. But at the most basic form, SQL(Structured Query Langugage) to 
is used to operate with the data. 
- Different frameworks providing RDMS are MySQL, Oracale, MS SQL Server etc

SQL - 
It is mainly classified into following categories:
1. DDL - Data Definition Language : Mainly used for creating/deleting structure in the database. The most common operations are 
create table, delete/drop the table, alter table structure etc. You create the table structure and provide the different 
constraints and conditions on the table. 
2.DML - Data Manipulation Language : Used to manipulate the data in the tables bu using operations of insert,update,delete rows from the table.
3.DQL - Data Query Language : Used to query the database and fetch the records from the database. Operations used is SELECT. It is coupled with conditions
and constraints for fetching the required data. Operations used are where clause, groupby, subquery etc. 
  
--> Database Server/Client
- Database server on MYSQL has to be installed on the user's desktop/laptop. 
- MYSQL consists of both the server and client side. The business logic is written on the server side. 
- You can also connect to AWS or remote RDMS structures. Thereby, you can use chrome plugin to connect the AWS table and perform operations. 

--> CRUD of single table: Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete from the table. 
 Create - forms a new record in the table by using the command 'insert into table values(column values)'
 Retrieve - query and fetch the records you want from the table. Command is 'select * from table where condition*'
 Update - This is to alter the row and change the value of a specific column (or multiple columns). Command is 'update table_name set column_name = new_value where column_name = old_value'
 Delete - Delete the record from the table. Command is 'delete from table_name where column_name = value'

--> Relationship in tables : We need to classify the relationship between the tables in a database. 
        one-one: 
	- One to One relation is done when the primary key of one table is used as foreign key in another table having only one record. 
	- Table having the primary key is the master table and the one with the foreign key is the dependent table. 
	one-many:
	- One record in a table is related to one or more rows in the foreign table. 
        many-many
	- Situation where many records in the master are indirectly referenced to multiple rows in reference table. 
	- For doing so, we need an intermediate table between the master and reference table. 

--> Fetching data from multiple tables
         Joins -> 
	 This operation is done by joining two tables using foreign key constraint. There are mainly three types of joins in SQL:
	 1. Inner Join - Common records are retrieved from both the table. 
	 2. Left Join - Retrieves the record from the left table and common records from the right table. 
	 3. Right Join - Similarly, fetched all the records from the right and common records from the left table. 

	 Union ->
	 It doesn't actually join the two tables. It just fetches the records from two tables and displays it together. 
	 Unlike joins, it avoids the duplicate records. 
	 Used to combine the result set of two select statements.Union ALL fetches the duplicate from more than one table.
