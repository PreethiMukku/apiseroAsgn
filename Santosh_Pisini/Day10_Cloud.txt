Cloud Services:
==> IAAS:
	Customization from OS, middleware(language), runtime, applications, and data is allowed.
	AWS EC2
==> PAAS:
	Customization from applications and data is allowed.
	Github, Amazon Relational Database Service
==> SAAS:
	Here we directly use the service and not bother about anything.
	Gmail, Zoom


Auto-Scaling:
To reinitialize a new instance if older one gets killed or crashed.
AutoScailing is preferred when the load is known.
==> Step scaling -> All instance together 
==> Simple scaling -> 1 after 1

-> Desired, Min, and Max instances can be configurable

--> Auto scaling to 0 when you want to remove auto-scaling.


Load Balancer:
To distribute the load that we are getting on our servers.
Usually, we use the round-robin algorithm.
Flexibility to add or remove servers.
==> In real-time we use a load balancer and auto-scaling together.

--> AWS has inbuilt DNS mapping to hide functionality from the end-user.
