Application Developmen

Types of Clients
 	Rich Client(run on client side)
-Required installation.
-It is platform /os dependent.
-No server dependancy.
-Need to redistribute if version changes.
-Scaling of application is provided.
-Client expections are high in terms of storage/memory/CPU.
-Ex.eclipse.
	
  Thin Clients (run on server side)
-Browser and network required.
-Cost savings.
-Provide facility to Work remotely.
-Maintainablity and versioning is automatic as code is on server
-Dependent on server.
-But round trip required to server and back for data.
-No platform dependancy.
-No client expectations like OS or Storage.
-Ex.reqres.in,Google search.
	
   RIA(Rich Internet Client)
-Similar to thin client.
-But goto server and fetch data asynchronously.(do backgroung work mostly inj avascript)  
-Reduce time of round trip bycaching of data-get response faster than thin client as it is already downloded.
-Ex.flipkart,Gmail(you can read unread messages even if you stop your internet connection)

	Mobile Applications
-Need mobile .
-Mostly combilnation of rci and ria.
-Platform dependent.
-Expectations on client.
-Maintainability and versioning is concern.
-Online(games) as well as hybrid(games).
-Offline but sync to server ex.goggle calender.

Different Orientations
	Procedure Oriented
-Data is not given that importance.(global/function parameters)
-Concentrate on code more.
-C language.
	
	Object Oriented
-Data is very important and protected.
-Use methods to encapsulate/hide data.
-Java language.
	
	Component Oriented
-Insteade of using class as whole entity use combination of classes and interface as entity)
-java.lang.* -> (JavaSE) 
-javax.ejb.* -> (JavaEE) basically extension to java.
-Ex.Javabeans,RMI,EJB,Corba.
	
	Service Oriented
-Service-orientation encourages reuse in all services, regardless if immediate requirements for reuse exist
-Has to be loosely coupled (change the service provider any time)-> (in terms of technology,flexibility,interfaces)
-Instead of buying use it as service.
-Ex. cloud services,payment gateways used in online shopping sites,using google seach engine as service for your website.

Different Types of Languages
	Compiled
-Compilers read and analyze the code only once, and report the errors collectively
-C,C++,java
	
	Scripting
-Do not require the compilation step and they are interpreted.
-Will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error.
-JavaScript or PHP

	Application Changes
Fast modifications
-Some needs to change its version as early as possible depending on compitition.
-Goggle started its Gmeet as soon as peolple started using video calls more in lockdown.
Common code with multiple Interfaces
Need of Integration with different applicationsÂ  
-interface of different application should match
-else mapping rules can be applied
-create your own rules and use those for mapping
