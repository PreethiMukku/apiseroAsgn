Application Developmen

Types of Clients
 	Rich Client(run on client side)
-it is platform /os dependent
-no server dependancy
-need to redistribute if version changes.
-scaling of application is provided
-client expections are high in terms of storage/ram
-ex.eclipse,calender mobile application
	
  Thin Clients (run on server side)
-Cost savings
- Work remotely
-maintainablity is automatic
-dependent on server
-round trip required for data
-no platform dependancy
-no client expectations
-ex.reqres.in
	
  RIA
-similar to thin client
-goto server and fetch data asynchronously
-get response faster than thin client

Mobile Applications
-need mobile 
-platform dependent
-expectations on client
-maintainability is not easy 
-online(games) as well as hybrid(games)
-offline but sync to server ex.goggle calender

Different Orientations
	Procedure Oriented
-data is not given that importance
-C language.
	Object Oriented
-data is very important and protected.
-Java language.
	Component Oriented
-Javabeans
	Service Oriented
-Service-orientation encourages reuse in all services, regardless if immediate requirements for reuse exist
-payment gateways used in online shopping sites
Different Types of Languages
	Compiled
-compilers read and analyze the code only once, and report the errors collectively
-c,c++,java
	Scripting
-Do not require the compilation step and they are interpreted.
-will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error.
-JavaScript or PHP

	Application Changes
Fast modifications
-some needs to change its version as early as possible depending on compitition.
Common code with multiple Interfaces
Need of Integration with different applications  
-interface of different application should match
-else mapping rules can be applied
-create your own rules and use those for mapping
