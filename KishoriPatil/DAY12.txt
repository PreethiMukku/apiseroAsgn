Integration
	-Connecting our application with different services.
	-SOA mostly has B TO B communications.
	-combining software parts 


EX:following situation where integration will be required for implementing the software.


Airline Office(Jet Airways)
	- Reservation Counter---> software for that 
	- Rich Client 1-------->Application + db(MySQL)
	- Business Requirement----scalability----- Rich Client 1 and 2 have Shared Database




2. Airline-->add to Cities--->Multiple flights---> multiple city offices

	Rich Client--------------component (on my Server)---------------1 Db
	Rich Client		          (Shared Code)(component)
	



3. Airline------>Rich --to->Thin Client
	

	Web/Browser Client--------Servlet/jsp---------component my Server---------1 Db
					tomcat
	



4. Infosys wants--> Flight booking--> team(5..20)--> LocA--to--LocB
	-problem:-seperate from ---to information has to be entered for each seat

	-expectation----> B-B request
	Web/ Browser Client--------- Write one web page-----------component(Server)--------1 Db	
    (one transaction for group booking)service()----------------component(Server)--------1 Db


-----------------------------------------------
INTERFACES :
	-jetairways: private string(from,to,date,passenger)
	-Makemytrip : (from,to,day,mont,year)
	-clear trip : (from (cityname),to (cityname),datewithtimestamp,details (1+))


Solution for above problem is as follow:
Bottom up approach(JAVA):
	-code is giving first pirority then comes  desgin requirement(interface).
	-don't tightly coupled with makemytrip /clear trip
	-design your own interface:--Myinterface

	-convert makemytrip and clear trip data to Myinterface using mmt and ct adapters
	-send get request---wait for getting data --convert/format--data collected-----send it to my data interface



-----------------------------------------------	
now consider Makemytrip:

services----->how to connect to different airlines
	-------->connect using Interfce/restAPI they offer
 	code is approached (TopDown Approach)----------->Integration in picture

	-service  for booking
	-service for cancel  booking
	-Web. Browser Client ---------Restservice()--------component(Server)--------1 Db	
					

----------------------------------------------------------------------
compensation workflow:

EX: HDFC -------(transaction)----->ICICI         							

1.Open the connection(HDFC)----decrease the amount----close the connection 

2.open the connection (ICICI)--increase the amount----close the connection

if transaction not succeded in icici then you get your money in hdfc back is called as compensation

--------------------------------------------------------------


Messaging:
	-communication between software components or applications.
	-enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled.
	-a send message(gmail) ---Messaging server-----b get message(apisero)

Messaging Types:
	-point to point
		-delivered to one receiver 
		-gauranted delivery
	-Published subscriber
		-message is delivered to all the subscribers
		-Chances of loosing information.

JMS:
	-JMS is the standard messaging API
	-Asynchronous messaging
	-reliable and message delivery is sure.

security:
clientuse SSL format to send accdetails--to--MMT-------AIR ASIA(ssl,auth)
Jet(ssl,auth)------->payment gateway

OAuth 
	-authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain a limited access to an HTTP service.
	-open standard protocol for authentication that allows a user to use Internet service functions, such as those provided by Facebook, within other applications 

------------------------------------------------------
Fan out:
	makemytrip sent request to 4 airline
 
Fan in:
	-taking responce from all airlines and Conversion of format to mmt i.e collection of data from all airlines as one unit to makemytrip
