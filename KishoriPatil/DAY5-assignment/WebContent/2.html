<br>Day 2 - Programming Fundamentals	
<br>OOPS Concepts
<br><br>
<br>Abstraction
<br>-focus on what object does than how it is done.
<br>-User will know everything they need to know about the object without the background details or explaination.
<br>-Hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential details.
<br>-Ex.Atm machine,sort function of Arrays class.we know that we have to pass array to it and it will sort that array but we dont know how it is sorting it.

<br><br>Encapsulation
<br>-data and member functions are bind together and keep them safe from outside interference.
<br>-Ex: capsule, In class we can make all datamembers private and use getters and setters to access it.
<br><br>

<br>Inheritance
<br>-Using this object of one class inherits the proprties of another class.
<br>-Data members are common in two classes then inheritance is used.
<br>-Ex:base class inherit the properties of super class.
<br>-Inheritance can break encapsulation if class members are declared as protected but if they are private then.
<br>-class can extend only one class.
<br>-Purpose :-
<br>	-maximum time for common data members not for reusability of code(use instance and involk methode).
<br>	-type-interface(blueprint for class).
<br>		-syn: class implements interface.
	<br>	-class can implement many interfaces.
- <br>-for inheritance,if there are common data members then it will give ambiguity therefor class can extend only one class.. 
-<br><br>

<br>Polymorphism
<br>-many form
<br>-Ex:one methode with different implementations.
<br>-polymorphism can be:
<br>	-compile time
<br>		-overloading of methods.
<br>		-binding is of overloaded methods is done at compiletime
<br>	-runtime
<br>		-overriding of methods.
	<br>	-Ex: depending on whether the super or sub class if calling,methods are involked.
