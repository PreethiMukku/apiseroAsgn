<br>Day 3, Day 4 OOP(Core Java)	+Eclipse
<br>Java Fundamentals .. Quick View<br>
<br>JAVA a platform independent language
<br>-	a separate file is created for a compiled program. 
<br>-	This file (.class) is called bytecode which cannot be executed directly. 
<br>-	It does not include executable codes. 
<br>-	Instead it will be converted into executable code by JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE.
<br>-	Byte code generated in a particular platform can be executed in any other platform. <br>
<br>-	compiler send the generated bytecodes to the JVM and this JVM converts the byte codes into machine code which is readable by a particular machine.
<br>-	JRE on many platform.
<br><br>
PACKAGE
<br>-	grouping of classes.
<br>-	must be mapped to folder hierarchy.
<br>-	you need to import these packages.
<br>-	Ex: java.lang ,java.sql
<br> 
 
<br>-	Every class extend object class.

<br>-	filename and main class name has to be same when your class is public.
<br>-	when we have more than 1 class in .java file and we perform javac that time all classes get their .class file seperately.
<br>-	to execute those classes you need to write different commands for each class(java a.java)
<br>-	javac -s. calc.java---for source file
<br>-	javac -d.calc.java----crete folder first then .java(destination).
<br>-	need to map package name to directory structure
<br><br>

<br>VARIABLES
<br>holds the value while the Java program is executed.
 <br>local: (belongs to method)
<br>declared inside the body of the method .
<br>SCOPE is only within that method
<br><br>
 instance: (belongs to instance)
<br>-	declared inside the class but outside the body of the method
<br>-	value is instance specific and is not shared among instances.
<br>-	ex: int a=6;
<br><br>
 static: (belongs to class)<br>
-	create a single copy of static variable and share among all the instances of the class. <br>
-	Memory allocation for static variable happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.<br>
-	ex: static int a=4;<br><br>
ARRAY<br>
-	collection of data with same datatype .<br>
-	After creation, its length is fixed.<br>
-	if  array of object then default is NULL as stores reference address.<br>
declaration and memory allocation<br>
        int[] a = new int[10];<br>
initialize and printing element<br>
        a[0] = 100;<br>
Sop("Element at index 0: "+ a[0]);<br>
<br><br>
java doesn't use pass by  reference<br>
<br>
INHERITANCE<br>
	ABSTRACT<br>
Class:    -Can't instantiated<br>
	-Use when u want inheritance +STATIC<br>
	-No restriction to have abstract method.<br>
	-Can contain common n abstract and final methods<br>
Method:  -No body in super class<br>
	     -extending class need to define this method<br>
	     -if abstract methode is their then the class has to be abstract<br>
	<br><br>
	FINAL<br>
Class:- to avoid -->base class can overide the methods in superclass.<br>
	-No change ONLY USE.<br>
	-can't be parent class<br>
Method:-can't override this methode.<br>
<br>
	interface<br>
-one interface can be implemented by many classes.<br>
-can create object of class with interface reference<br>
-no data variables,actual methodes<br>
-only abstract methods<br>
-EX:<br>
interface M{<br>
  public void m1();   // interface method (does not have a body)<br>
}<br>
class P implements M{<br>
  public void m1()<br>
    System.out.println("Zzz");<br>
  }}<br>
class MainClass {<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
    P p =  new P();<br>
M P= new P();<br>
  } }<br><br>
 
-	abstract contains data members where as interface don't<br>
-	cant OVERRIDE by return type.<br>
-	can overload methods by giving different parameters.<br>
-	Exception handling: use try catch block.<br>
<br>
Collection API (List, Set, Map)<br>
ARRAYLIST<br>
-	Collection of items<br>
-	Duplicates excepted<br>
-	 Ordering/sorting(FCFS)<br>
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();<br>
	list.add("AA");<br>
	list.remove(1);<br>
	System.out.println(list);<br>
	list.set(1,"22222222222");<br>
	System.out.println(list);<br>
<br>
HashSet <br>
-	Collection of items that uses a hash table for storage<br>
-	No Duplicates excepted<br>
-	Ordering/sorting OF Elements internally<br>
Set<Integer> l2  = new HashSet<>();<br>
	l2.add(11);// convert int to Integer -> Boxing <br>
	System.out.println("hashset:   "+l1);
<br><br>
HashMap<br>
-Store items in key/value  pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type String ).<br>
-No Duplicates excepted<br>
-Ordering/sorting OF Elements internally<br>
Map<String,Integer> map =new TreeMap<>();<br>
		map.put("Sima", 60);<br>
				System.out.println(map);<br>
		System.out.println("Marks for Lina = " + map.get("Lina"));<br>
<br>
    Threads<br>
Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program<br>
class A implements Runnable<br>
 public void run()  //override this<br>
   {<br>
	}<br>
	LifeCycle<br>
-class overrides the run() method available in the Thread class.<br>
- A thread begins its life inside run() method. <br>
-We create an object of our new class and call start() method to start the execution of a thread..<br>
	Start<br>
 Start() invokes the run() method on the Thread object which is overloaded in class.<br>
	join<br>
join the start of a thread’s execution to end of other thread’s execution such that a thread does not start running until another thread ends
	<br>sleep<br>
 Causes the currently executing thread to sleep(stop executing ) for the specified number of milliseconds
