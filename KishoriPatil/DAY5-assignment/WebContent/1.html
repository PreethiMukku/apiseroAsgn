<h2> Day 1 - Computer Fundamentals	<br>
Application Developmen<br>

Types of Clients<br>
 	Rich Client(run on client side)<br>
-Required installation.<br>
-It is platform /os dependent.<br>
-No server dependancy.<br>
-Need to redistribute if version changes.<br>
-Scaling of application is provided.<br>
-Client expections are high in terms of storage/memory/CPU.<br>
-Ex.eclipse.<br><br>
	
  Thin Clients (run on server side)<br>
-Browser and network required.<br>
-Cost savings.<br>
-Provide facility to Work remotely.<br>
-Maintainablity and versioning is automatic as code is on server<br>
-Dependent on server.<br>
-But round trip required to server and back for data.<br>
-No platform dependancy.<br>
-No client expectations like OS or Storage.<br>
-Ex.reqres.in,Google search.<br><br>
	
   RIA(Rich Internet Client)<br>
-Similar to thin client.<br>
-But goto server and fetch data asynchronously.(do backgroung work mostly inj avascript) <br> 
-Reduce time of round trip bycaching of data-get response faster than thin client as it is already downloded.
-Ex.flipkart,Gmail(you can read unread messages even if you stop your internet connection)<br>
<br>
	Mobile Applications<br>
-Need mobile .<br>
-Mostly combilnation of rci and ria.<br>
-Platform dependent.<br>
-Expectations on client.<br>
-Maintainability and versioning is concern.<br>
-Online(games) as well as hybrid(games).<br>
-Offline but sync to server ex.goggle calender.<br>
<br>
Different Orientations<br>
	Procedure Oriented<br>
-Data is not given that importance.(global/function parameters)<br>
-Concentrate on code more.<br>
-C language.
	<br><br>
	Object Oriented<br>
-Data is very important and protected.<br>
-Use methods to encapsulate/hide data.<br>
-Java language.<br>
	<br>
	Component Oriented<br>
-Insteade of using class as whole entity use combination of classes and interface as entity)<br>
-java.lang.* -> (JavaSE) <br>
-javax.ejb.* -> (JavaEE) basically extension to java.<br>
-Ex.Javabeans,RMI,EJB,Corba.
	<br><br>
	Service Oriented<br>
-Service-orientation encourages reuse in all services, regardless if immediate requirements for reuse exist<br>
-Has to be loosely coupled (change the service provider any time)-> (in terms of technology,flexibility,interfaces)<br>
-Instead of buying use it as service.<br>
-Ex. cloud services,payment gateways used in online shopping sites,using google seach engine as service for your website.
<br><br>
Different Types of Languages<br>
	Compiled<br>
-Compilers read and analyze the code only once, and report the errors collectively<br>
-C,C++,java
	<br><br>
	Scripting<br>
-Do not require the compilation step and they are interpreted.<br>
-Will read and analyze the code statements each time it meets them and halts at that very instance if there is some error.
-JavaScript or PHP<br>
<br>
	Application Changes<br>
Fast modifications<br>
-Some needs to change its version as early as possible depending on compitition.<br>
-Goggle started its Gmeet as soon as peolple started using video calls more in lockdown.<br>
Common code with multiple Interfaces<br>
Need of Integration with different applications  <br>
-interface of different application should match<br>
-else mapping rules can be applied<br>
-create your own rules and use those for mapping<br>
