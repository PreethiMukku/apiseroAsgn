RDBMS: Relational data base management system is to define 
    dbms with relational model tables.
	
Client/server:
   -client/server is deal with various computing environment that have
   a large no of computers	and server connected to other.
   clients are user machine to interface and local processing capabilities,
   actually server serve to clients 
	

1.CREATE table:
CREATE TABLE table_name(
   column1 datatype,
   column2 datatype,
   column3 datatype,
   .....
   columnN datatype,
   PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns )
);
--->create table defines the table in the table we can enter the value in above table

cRUD:
CREATE,RETRIEVE,UPDATE,DELETE IN TABLE
2.INSERT TABLE:
          INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...valueN);
		  -BY USING ABOVE COMMAND WE CAN USE IN EVERY CREATE TABLE
		  EG:INSERT INTO SYSTE( 1,INTEL,MOUSE,CPU...);
_
3.UPDATE:BY USING THIS WE CAN MODIFY TABLE	
      Syntax:UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2...., columnN = valueN
WHERE [condition];

4.DELETE : DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];
we can del the record form table by using where condition.

--JOINS:   SELECT ID, NAME, AGE, AMOUNT
           FROM CUSTOMERS, ORDERS
           WHERE  CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID; 
		   Here there are two tables in that common data combined as one table.
		   joins types are: Inner join,Left Joins,right join,full join
		Union:SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

UNION;

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]
    UNION
SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]


Here, the given condition could be any given expression based on your require   

RELATIONAL TABLES:
 1.ONE TO ONE
 2.ONE TO MANY
 3.MANY TO MAY
 4. ONE TABLE FETCHING DATA FROM MULTIPLE TABLES
