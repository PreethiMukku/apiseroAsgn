-DevOps describes a culture and set of processes that bring development and operations teams together to complete software development. 
It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.

	---] Business Agility :-


1)Time-to market Accelaration :-	
One of the biggest reasons to run any project with an Agile approach is to take distance from any form of waste to win time.
The incentive to win time comes simply from the market.


2)Rapid prototypin :-	
Rapid prototyping is an agile strategy used throughout the product development process. With this approach, 
3-dimensional prototypes of a product or feature are created and tested in an attempt to optimize characteristics like shape, size, and overall usability.


3)Experimentation :-	
Organizational learning happens when people question the way things are, try things together and make meaning together. 
Since there is no one way to “do Agile” but many ways to practice Agility, experimentation explores what works and what doesn't for the people involved.


4)Flexible partnering :-	This means that the more partners there are, the more money they can put into the business, which will allow better flexibility and more potential for growth.
It also means more potential profit, which will be equally shared between the partners. 


5)iot/ios support :-	
The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network 
without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

 ---Technical innovation :-

Technological innovation is the process where an organization (or a group of people working outside a structured organization) 
embarks in a journey where the importance of technology as a source of innovation has been identified 
as a critical success factor for increased market competitiveness.




- Infrastructure choice :-	An Agile IT infrastructure is one that is designed to support rapid deployment and provisioning, and incremental upgrades and improvements. 
It takes its name from the development methodology made famous in the 2001 Manifesto for Agile Software Development.






 ex :- Java-----> javac ---->war file -------> tomcat.




-]Application Development :-	
Agile software development refers to software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development, 
where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. ...
Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used Agile methodologies.
It is dependent on the below environment :-


1)Development environment 

2)QA Environment


3)Testing Environment  





4)Production Environment 


 ex :- Java-----> javac ---->war file -------> tomcat.

-]Principle and Manifestor of Agile :-	




Manifesto :-




    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools


    Working software over comprehensive documentation


    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation


    Responding to change over following a plan




Principle :-


-]   UAT  (User Acceptance Testing) :-	


    Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.


    Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.


    Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.


    Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.


    Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.


    importance of UAT :-	    The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.


    Working software is the primary measure of progress.


    Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

    The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.




ex:- video needed to be downloaded before watching (earlier) <----------  Changed as UAT demanded it.	






-]   UAT  (User Acceptance Testing) :-

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is one of the last stages of the software development life cycle.
It is performed after the software has been thoroughly tested. It is sometimes known as End User Testing.




    Importance of UAT :-
    UAT is important because it helps demonstrate that required business functions are operating in a manner suited to real-world circumstances and usage.
    If the expected outcome is not achieved during testing, the item will be documented and sent back to the developers for repair.





ex:- video needed to be downloaded before watching (earlier) <----------  Changed as UAT demanded it.
