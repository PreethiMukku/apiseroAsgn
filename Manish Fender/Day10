====>Day 10<======

Recap for Day 9 :----
+ How MicroServices Communicate
+ Flow of MicroServices
+ Three/N tier Architecture
	-Persentation layer
	-Bussiness layer
	-Persistance
+Responsiblity segration Principle(Imp)
	-Each microservie should work with one unit Responsiblity
+ Cluster  ?
+ Load balancer ?

==>Cload computing<==
ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
->On demand self service
	-no human interaction	
->Broad network
	-0 to anny number availablity
->Resource pooling
	-need lots of empty resources which can be readly use at any given time
->Rapid elasticity
	-scale up and down
->Measured Service
	-pay according to usage only with proof


HOW COMMUNICATION IS DONE BETWEEN CLIENT AND SERVER  ???
	

CLIENT------------------------>LOAD BALANCER------------------------>SERVER
reruests -->	                software/hardware       	          (s1,s2,s3)
				
LOADBALANCER:--
+ Loadbalancer handle all the requests from the client and send it to the server using algorithm to balance the load.
  popular algorithm to handle the requests is round robin algorithm.
+  Multiple Microservice : Each microservice can have a seprate loadbalancer.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVERS :----
Developmet server
+ This server is used to develop,test and deploy the projects by the developer.

Production server
+ This server is used by the admin people to finally deploy the project from development server


Why Cloud   ????
Insted of having own datacenter we can use the exixting data centers managed by by other ,and can use it as a service

CLOUD----->SERVICE
IAAS : Infrastructure as a service.
	Ex : AWS (Amazon web services0),  Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE)
PASS : Platform as a service.
	Ex: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure.
SASS : software as a service.
	Ex :Google Apps, Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx,
 
 
CLOUD COMPUTING ADVANTAGES :---
+ Flexiblity
+ Disaster Recovery
+ Automatics software Updates
+ Capatial Expenditure Free
+ Capacity / Scaling
+ Increased speed and Agilty
+ Increased collobaration
+ Security



--------:SCALING :---------
AutoScaling : Reinitializing instances automatically

Scaleup policy: Increase in instances/machines/servers.
		In  upscaling if No. of requests or networkIn or (it could be any parameters set) based on which it increases
		 the Number of instances/machines/servers automatically for max limit we have set. Ex 5 instances.

ScaleDown policy: Decrease in instance/machines/servers.
		In  ScaleDown if No. of requests or networkIn or (it could be any parameters set) based on which it Decreases 
		the Number of instances/machines/servers automatically for min limit we have set. Ex 2 instances.
