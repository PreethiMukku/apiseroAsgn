+ Advantages ?
+ Disadvantages ?

==>TESTING<==
=>What is SOA  ?
+ Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, 
`through a communication protocol over a network.
+ These components can be any type of third party services
+ such as paymentgateway option embeded in an web application
+ In service oriented architecture, a number of services communicate with each other, in one of two ways: through passing data or through two 
  or more services coordinating an activity. 

=>What are different types of Orientations
1.Procedure orientation
+ Procedural oriented programming (pop):- A program in a procedural language is a list of instruction where each statement tells the computer
  to do something. It focuses on procedure (function) & algorithm is needed to perform the derived computation.
 
 2.Object Orintation
 + Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form
   of fields (often known as attributes or properties),and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
 
 3.Component Orientation
 + Component-oriented programming is a technique of developing software applications by combining pre-existing and new components, much the same way
   automobiles are built from other components.
   
 4.Service Orentation
 + Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. 
   SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies.
 
 =>What is Http protocol ?
+ HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
+ WWW is about communication between web clients and servers
+ Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses

=>Types of http requests
1	GET -> like a Read operation
The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

2	POST -> like a Create Operation
A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

3	PUT -> like a Update operation
Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

4	DELETE -> like a Delete operation
Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.



=>What is SOAP ?
+ SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
+ SOAP is a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main idea behind designing SOAP was
  to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner. 
+It support many protocols , and is xml based  
  
=>WHAT IS REST ?
+ This was designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular
  hardware device. Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. 
+ A Restful service would use the normal HTTP  of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components.

=>What is JUNIT Testing
+ JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of 
  test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.
  
=>Unit testing of web applications includes many testings such as-
-Core functionality testing...
-UI testing..  - Client side rendering
               - javascript
               - Interactive
               - etc...
  
=>What is Postman ?
+  Postman is an API(application programming interface) development tool which helps to build, test and modify APIs.
   It has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH), saving environments for later use,
   
=> what is TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD) ?
1.Write a Test. Since development is driven by tests, the obvious first step is to create a new test. ...
2.Confirm the Test Fails. Once the test is created, the next step is to confirm that the test fails. ...
3.Write Code to Pass Test. ...
4.Confirm the Test Passes. ...
5.Refactor. ...
6.Repeat All Steps.
+ It consist of automated unit test and automated integration test.

=>What is BEHAVIOURAL DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (BDD)  ?
+ It can be understand by the non technical people.
+  Tester, developer, bussiness people , come all together to create test measures and test cases.
