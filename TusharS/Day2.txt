- Overview of day 1

-Programming Fundamentals	

-OOPS Concepts
ORIENTATION
-> Data was not given due importance, too many snippets can change data.
- for this we had only two options, local and global variable.

here comes OOPS,
Grouping,, classification
- Data integration
-No modifications of data from outside.
 
 We create information, ie by creating objects.
 objects
 - instance of class 
 - Emp e = new Emp();

Abstraction
- only showing the required details, implementation details are hidden(core logic).
- google search engine.
- Abstraction is common done at various levels..(multiple perspective)

Encapsulation: 
Wrapping up data and methods into single unit, helps programmers for software development.

Inheritance
-inheriting properties from class, methods.
-keyword extends
- super class , sub class
-code reuse: instance and revoke method
- common data members, common methods.
- class can extend only one class and implment many interfaces
' Inheritance breaks encapsulation'-> when a class has private as well as public members .. and thers derivation .. then this terms to be assumpton

Interface
-exposing to the outer world
- all methods to be implemented
- all methods are public
- 
Polymorphism
-  multiple forms
- method overloading
 depending upon the context change forms
 method over riding 
 with parameters , inheritance
