Recap of Day 9
Resposibility Segregation Principle
Cloud Overview AWS Demo

Cloud Computing - Why Cloud?
Cloud computing facilitates the access of applications and data from any location worldwide and from any device with an internet connection. 
Cost savings; Cloud computing offers businesses with scalable computing resources hence saving them on the cost of acquiring and maintaining them.

The Old Approach - 
Machines/PC-------->Servers---------->Clusters
Server Scenario
Client------->Load Balancer------->Servers(s1,s2,s3)

Now we take it further 

Purchasing all these Machines
-Services - Pay/Usage
-Cost
-Maintainability - Installation/Configuration of Hardware/Software abd maintaining of other resources.
-Instead of using custom data centres we can use it as a service.

1.On Demand Self Service
-Create new machines.

2.Broad Network access
-Laptops, DEsktops etc.

3.Resource Pooling(Huge Hardware/Software)
-Must be available with you

4.Rapid Elasticity
-Whenever load or traffic increases , no. of servers must increase and vice versa , i.e that is scale up and down whenever necessary.

5.Measured Service
-Be able to use how much ever and pay for just that and a proof is recorded.



Popular Cloud Vendors - Amazon/Microsoft/Google
Most countries created a hardware setup in each mainstream region---->Region(H/W Created here)------>We have minimum two zones whee regions are big , they also have support for 10 zones or so.
From our PC we can connect to any region.

As a Service
1.Infrastructure as a Service(IAAS) - Services such as Storage , Processing and Network.
2.Platform as a service(PAAS) - Services such as Operating System , Installations and configurations.PAAS is a combination of Infrastructure , Middleware and Run Time which
is managed by the vendor.
3.Software as a Service(SAAS) - IAAS+PAAS+Software----->We just configure it and use its services

Hosted a Web application on AWS.
