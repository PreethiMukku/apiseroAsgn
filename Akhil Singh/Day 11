DevOPs ----->Developement + Operation
1.Monolith - 24hrs
Developement -->Deployment--->Testing
Deployment done by Admin

2.Microservices
-10 to 20 microservices----->Compilation----->Deployment
          Java----->Javac----->War file----->Tomcat
          NodeJs------>npm----->Directory----->node launch file
          
Now we look into End to End Developemet

DevOps Tools
1.To easily connect to teams
-Skype
-Slack
-Github

2.Issue Tracking 
-Rapid Response
-Tools-Zendesk
       Jira
       Redmine
       
3.Source Control
-Controlled Assets
-Centralized and Decentralized Repositories

Our Developement workflow can be automated.
Automation - Integration of Github with jenkins , there must be automatic Jar files , automatic test cases and be deployed on AWS.

Containers---->When one OS Kernel is divided via virtualization.

System Developement Life Cycle
-Planning
-System Analysis and Requirements.
-System Design
-Developement
-Integration and Testing
-Implementation
-Operation and Maintainence

After every step , validation procedures are done and only then can we go to the next phase.
This model is not the scenario cause wastage of resources and we cannot go back to the previous phases
hence we move ro Agile Methods.

Agile Manifesto
We follow these principles:
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

User Acceptance Testing(UAT)-Final level of testing , show customer the end results and then launch.

Tips for UAT
-Set Clear Expectations
-UAT Should be done early and at regular intervals.

Jira - Issue tracking software
- A demo was implemented showing the entire workflow of Jira.
