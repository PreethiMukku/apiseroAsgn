Relational Database Management Systems(MySql)
MongoDB(NoSql) - A DB system which does not use structured query language.

DDL(Data Definition Language) - Used for Defining the tables , table values , it's constraints and it's primary key.
DML(Data Modification Language) - Used to perform CRUD Operations on a given database and also to query the database.

Example 1 - Creation of a Table with details of a Department

create table dept(
deptno tinyint,
dname varchar(20),
location char(3),
primary key (deptno) 
);

And operations performed on the table were

insert into dept values('1','Fin','BLr');// to insert value into the table
select * from dept;// to read table
update single set loc ='Pun'where deptno = 1;//Update 
delete * from dept;// Drop the table

Then we learnt how to create instances of tables and then perform operations between the tables using the following  - GROUP BY,DISTINCT , AVG , MAX , MIN and so on .

Joins - Left Outer , Right outer , Outer , Inner , Outer Joins.
Used to perform various cartesian sets between tables.
