Computer Fundamentals

Types of Clients
1. Rich Client - Complete Installation of the software on the client's system . Uses CPU , Memory and overhead services . If we use all resources of he client , then it's called a 
                 Rich Client(Thick Client).
                 Issues - (i)We have to give an exe or msi file.(However we can Convert exe files to its source code using intermediate languages)
                          (ii)Constant changes in Version.
                          (iii)Maintainability.
                          (iv) Tightly Coupled with OS/System Architecture.
2.Thin Client - All we need is a browser and a functioning network , code distribution is'nt required , hence code is safe , it's simple to handle versioning/maintainability and 
                OS is not taken into consideraion.
                Issues - Round Trip - The Server and client are constantly communicating.
3. Rich Inernet Application(RIA) - Intermediate solution from rich to thin client . Caches important services and data so that the communication between server and client is reduced.
4.Mobile Applications.

Different Types of Orientation in Programming Languages

1.Procedure Oriented - Concenexecution line by line .
2.Object Oriented - Data is most crucial entity and data is wrapped with methods ,  we concentrate on one thing at a time.
3.Component Oriented - Combination of classes and interfaces.
4.Service Oriented - Where services are offered by top vendors.
