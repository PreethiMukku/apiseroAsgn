Static Methods:
  -Static methods/class/var  uses common memory space of program.
  -There is no need to create object for static class/method.
  
Abstract class:
  -We cannot create a object of abstract class,but we can inherit it within other class.
  -A abstract class can have both normal as well as abstract methods.
  -But if we declare method as abstract then that class should be abstract class.
  -If we dont want to define method then we acn make that method as abstract but whenever we call that method
    in another class we have to define it.
  -Abstract method do not have any body.
  -Also we can give static calls to abstract method.
  
Final:
  -Final class cannot be inherited,but instance can be created.
  -if a class is final, it cannot be inherited or extended by sub classes /derived class.
  -Final method cannot be override.
  
  Exception Handling:
     -TRY,CATCH,AND FINALLY BLOCK.
     -If we feel some particular block of code can give error then we can put that part of code in try block and catch block handles it.
     -Some particular block of code need to have executed by default then we can put it into finally.
     
   Collection Framework:
    -This framework is used for standerdization of code and its storage,also speedup the process and reduce the code.
    -can perform different operations on it like insert,delete,update etc.
    -Collection framework includes interfaces,implementation and different algorithms.
    -Different collection frameworks interfaces are list,map etc. 
    -We cannot create object of it but we can create arraylist,linklist associated with it.
    
  Thread:
    -predefined class of java
    -handles execution of programs alternatively  
    -speedup the process.
    
  Features of java:
    -Platform independent
    -portable
    -multithreaded
    -allows dynamic programming
    
  Limitations:
      -due to inheritance,encapsulation code code develops tight coupling in between the class and methods.
      -Also due to it dependency increases.
      -due to all dependency it will become soo hectic for any new person to change anything in that code.(if requirements changes)
      
    New concepts:
    collection framework:map,list etc and its operations.
    threading mechanism.
    Practical knowlege has increased.
