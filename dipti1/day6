DATABASE
----------------------
Database: online db-db-fiddle
 
RDBMS(SQL)- database in a tabular format. (all entries have same formats/attributes) eg mysql

NoSQL- each document can be different. eg- MongoDB

RDBMS works with CRUD operations.
create,update,delete and retrieve.

steps:
1.creating database:
CREATE DATABASE databasename;

2.retroving db details:
SELECT * FROM table_name;

3.updating records/particular record :
UPDATE Customers
	SET ContactName = 'xyz', City= 'pune'
	WHERE CustomerID = 3;
  
4.deleting records:
delete from Customers where CustomerName='abc';

Association:
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
Each record should be unique.
Duplicate entries are not allowed in database. 
PRIMARY KEY is associated with the main table and FOREIGN KEY helps to link that table to another.

we can create our own constraint for easy use.

Different types of  Relationship associated with tables,
are: one-one,one-many,many-many
        
Clause:Where, group by etc
eg: group by:
select count(*) from emp;
select job, max(sal) from emp
group by job
having job='MANAGER'

SQL JOINS
A JOIN clause is used to combine two tables based on its column.
Different Types of SQL JOINs:
Inner join:
SELECT d.deptno
FROM dept d
INNER JOIN emp e ON e.deptno = d.deptno

Outer Join:
Left outer join 
Full outer join

Union:Used to combine two tables.
eg: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
		UNION ALL
		SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
