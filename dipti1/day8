TESTING:

Code Coverage:
How much part of code is getting tested.

Testing is done to make sure that code is working properly and is it ready for deploying.
we use different test cases for testing particular modules.

Test Driven Developement And Behaviour driven developement:
  Test Driven Developement 
  In this Test Cases are given first and then developer is asked to create code which satisfies these test cases.
  Also we get clarity about what to code according to test cases so it saves time.In this senario we can do unit testing and integration testing.

Behaviour driven developement:
In this we observe behavior of program while execution and compare if its matches given requirements,
and checks its behaviour.At the end of it acceptance testing is done.

Testing Rich Client:
 Junit 

Testing REST services
Service oriented arch(SOA)

Testing Thin Client
Web Applicaions 
checking UI (testing)

REST services
Uses JSON
HTTP,HTTPS protocol is used.
can be test using url on postman.
Implementation of REST Service Request using 
get,post,put,delete methods.

SOAP services
XML based.
Protocols used HTTP,FTP
we can define our operations.

Both rest and soap are not that secure.
