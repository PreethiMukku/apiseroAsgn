MVN AND GIT CONCEPTS
-----------------------------------------
Checkout and Checkin concepts

Dev1 -> Checkout prog.java  -->Permission to modify the code to only dev1
-->Grant Permission 
-->Change code
compile...
-->CheckIn Code(modified)
	->build the project  
	-> commit
Dev2 -> Checkout prog.java (Deny Permission)


Version Control:
create local copy of any program to change or modify in it.
Types:
Local,Centralized,Distributed

Git Operations/commands:
git init
create empty git repository

git add .  --> adding current dir in add
-m added
commit
git pull location master(pull into file)


git init
git pull  url master
git commit -a -m message
git remote adddir
 url 
git push
get clone -v  url

Repository operations:
If different developers wants to add some part of code into existing code,but also flow of the program should be maintained then we create different 
branches for the same.
after completion of it we can merge different branches or can be specifilly add one of it depending on the requirements.

Maven:
With the help of mvn we can control the flow of execution of program.
We can use different goals while running mvn proj and can export as a executable jar file with others for further use.
Goals:
clean,clean install package
package
compile
test compile
test
compile
install
deploy

If jar file has any dependency then it will be found in .m2 folder of users.
We can download any dependencies from mvn central repository with the help of pom file.
