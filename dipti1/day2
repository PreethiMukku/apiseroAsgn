Object oriented programming

orientation->code

  -Data has not given that much importance as compared to code.
  -Uses local and global varibles. 
  -Code has its data and methods in it which has no external access or 
   external user cannot access it for that we have to define data members as private and member functions can be public.
   -In member funtion we write our business logic.
   -for eg:  member function-showdata,print funtn,, data members like emp_ID,salary etc...
   
As program is collection of different classes and methods and objects,so

  -OBJECT: It is the instance of the class.
  -CLASS : It is collection of objects.

Creating object:
emp e=new emp;

OPPS concepts:
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details or details which are not that much neccessary to know to 3rd party
eg:ATM machine

Encapsulation: Binding up the data and methods together in one module
eg:real time eg can be capsule,laptop etc

Inheritance: Using some part of code into another class for the code reusability 
  -In inheritance we use extends keyword for including any class into another.
  -Main class is known as parent/super/base class and the class which is extending funtionalities of main class is known 
   as child/sub/derived class.
   -Types of inheritance
   1.simple
   2.multilevel
   3.multiple
   4.hierarchy
   5.hybrid
   -Multiple inheritance is not supported by java coz it can cause ambiguity but by the use of interfaces we can acheive it.
   
Interface:
  -Interface is nothing but blueprint of the class,which gives an idea about what will be the output of the code
  -Basically what we want to expose to the outside world is coded into it.
  eg:display method/print
  
Polymorphism:
  Having multiple forms.
  It has 2 types
  1.overloading-same method name different parametrs within same class
  2.overriding:same method name same parameters but in different class
  
JAVA has the compile time realation that means it gives error at compile time only if something is not done properly.
