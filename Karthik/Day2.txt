Programming Fundamentals	
	OOPS Concepts
		Abstraction:
		1. Hiding the implementation details/business logic from the user and 			
		showing only the details essential for the user.
		2. When using sort function, the actual implementation and logic is not 			
		known, only the parameters to be sent and return type is known.
		Encapsulation:
		1. Bundling the data members and member function together. 
		2. Data cannot be accessed directly, it can be accessed only through 				
		methods(getters and setters).
		3. Data members are declared as private, and corresponding member 				
		functions are declared public. 
		Inheritance:
		1. Inheritance is used when we have common data member between the 			
		classes.
		2. For code reuse, directly create instance and revoke the method instead of 			
		inheritance.
		3. For using super class as the type, use interface instead of inheritance. In 			
		java, interface supports multiple inheritance.
		Polymorphism:
		1. Poly - Multiple, morphism - forms. Member functions supporting many 			
		forms.
		2. When a method with same name and signature is in parent and child class, 			
		and if the object of the child called is made and the method is revoked then 			
		child class method overrides the parent class method.
		3. Method with same name but different signatures is called method 				
		overloading.
