Testing:
- Testing is important as it helps is detecting errors and bugs in software. Thus, helps in increasing quality of the software and making software more reliable.

Test Driven Development:
- In TDD, the development phase starts with writing the test cases first.
- The test cases for each method and functionality are written first according to the client requirements and then keeping this test cases as reference developer does coding.

Behavior Driven Development:
- In BDD, developers,clients, testers sit together and colate the application requirements. 
  Thus the entire understanding of the application functionalities is done well at the start itself. 
- These details are documented, and reffering to this actual development starts.
- TDD and BDD usually goes hand in hand. With the help of BDD, all the requirements and details are well known at first place and then we follow TDD 
  i.e. according to the specifications test cases are developed. 
  
Rich Client Testing:
- We use Junit for rich client testing, where a test method is created for each method in the application. 
  In this test method we have test cases written and check if the method functions according to the requirements and if do we have any bugs in that particular method.
  
SOA: 
- Loosely coupled, faster modifications are per requirement. It defines an architecture for communication between B2B services.

  SOAP:
  - Supports any protocol.
  - XML based data format.
  - We have define our own methods.
  - Disadvantages: (n+1) problem, parsing problem.
  
  REST:
  - Http protocol.
  - JSON data format is mainly used. Also supports other data formats.
  - Methods: put/get/post/delete
  
Coverage:
- Determines whether all the test cases written are covering the entire application code. Thus it is a metric used to know how many code is coverered in testing.

Postman:
- We use postman for testing APIs. Requests are sent specifying the methods(put/get/post/delete) and body. We get back response in json format.
