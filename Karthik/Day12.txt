Integration:
- Integration is connecting different services or components into one system. 
- Previously we had component based architecture, were the entire components were built with in. 
- Now moving towards SOA, integration plays an important role as we need to integrate many services into our system. 

- As we move towards Service oriented architecture, there is high chances of us having B2B communication in our application. 
- So we go with a top to bottom approach and here we need to first think of all the integrations i.e. third party serives, APIS, B2B communication 
that is going to happen with our application and accordingly design and code it. 	
- Therefore we need integration as communication between different websites is important.

Messaging:
- Messaging APIs are used when two software applications want to communicate with each other. 
- They exchange data between themselves. It follows asynchronous messaging i.e. even if both are not connected, the message is been shared. 
- Sender sends the message, it is been stored in queue and the message pops up to the receiver once he connects.

eg JMS
P2P(Point to Point)
1. Guranteed delivery
2. There is only one receiver
3. After the message is received by the receiver,it is deleted from the queue.

Publish Subscribe Model
1. Many receivers.
2. No guranteed delivery.

Security: 
- For security we take care of SSL between different websites. 
- And access token and other authorization is done to maintain security between two applications while they are communicating.

FanIn: Multiple responses are combined into one single output.
eg. Data from different 3rd party services may be different, we combine it to one dta format within a interface.

FanOut: One request is sent and we get multiple responses.
