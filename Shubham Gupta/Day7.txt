Git Version Control System

A version control system is a software that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 
It also allows you to work together with other programmers.
The version control system is a collection of software tools that help a team to manage changes in a source code. It uses a special kind of database to keep track of every modification to the code.

Developers can compare earlier versions of the code with an older version to fix the mistakes.

Git comes with built-in GUI tools like git bash, git-gui, and gitk for committing and browsing.
It also supports several third-party tools for users looking for platform-specific experience.

Git Flow / Git Branching Model

It is referred to as Branching Model by the developers and works as a central repository for a project. 
Developers work and push their work to different branches of the main repository.

STAGE & SNAPSHOT
Working with snapshots and the Git staging area
git status
show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit

git add [file]
add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)

git reset [file]
unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory

git commit -m “[descriptive message]”
commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

BRANCH & MERGE

Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes
git branch
list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch

git branch [branch-name]
create a new branch at the current commit

git checkout
switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory

git merge [branch]
merge the specified branch’s history into the current one

git log
show all commits in the current branch’s history
