BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE : SERVER, CLUSTER AND LOAD BALANCERS

The architecture of a system can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier. An n-tier architecture divides 
the whole system into related but independent n modules, which can be independently modified, altered, changed, or replaced.

	--> In 1-tier architecture, the DBMS is the only entity where the user directly sits on the DBMS and uses it.
	--> If the architecture of DBMS is 2-tier, then it must have an application through which the DBMS can be accessed.
	Programmers use 2-tier architecture where they access the DBMS by means of an application.
	--> N-Tier: An N-Tier Application program is one that is distributed among three or more separate computers in a distributed network.

	Some of the popular sites who have applied this architecture are
		* MakeMyTrip.com
		* Sales Force enterprise application
		* Indian Railways – IRCTC
		* Amazon.com, etc.
		
	Advantages:
		* Scalability
		* Data Integrity
		* Reusability
		* Reduced Distribution
		* Improved Security
		* Improved Availability
		
	Disadvantages:
		* Increased Efforts
		* Increase in Complexity
		
ILLUSTRATION:
MAKE MY TRIP
	* PRESENTATION LAYER: Showing the UI ----> Its page rendered on dearch
	* BUSINESS LAYER: Invoking API/Webservices/(service class in JSP-SERVLET) ---> on seaching any airline the no. of times diffferent apis were evoked
	* PERSISTENT LAYER: Java code pertaining SQL query --> After API evocation no. of queries fired
    * DATA LAYER: Data Logics --> after booking data that what stored and etc
	
IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGIES:

	DOWNTIME: Downtime or outage duration refers to a period of time that a system fails to provide or perform its primary function.
	FAILOVER: Failover is a backup operational mode in which the functions of a system component (such as a processor, server, network, or database,
		  for example) are assumed by secondary system components when the primary component becomes unavailable through either failure or scheduled down time.
	LOADBALANCE: Load balancing is defined as the methodical and efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers
			in a server farm. Each load balancer sits between client devices and backend servers, receiving and then distributing incoming
			requests to any available server capable of fulfilling them.
	CLUSTER: It means that multiple servers(ALL STANDALONE) are grouped together to achieve the same business and can be regarded as one UNIT(HOSTING TOGETHER).
	
MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE: A monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program. Monolithic, in this context, means 
						composed all in one piece. 
						
MICROSERVICE: a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled service.


DISCOURSE: UBER APPLICATION

Uber uses microservice artitecture they usually refer it as ->
-Domain-Oriented Microservice Architecture.
-oriented around collections of related microservices. Called as Domain.
-map search services constitute a domain,
 fare services are a domain,
 matching platform (matching riders and drivers) are a domain.

-structured set of flexible, reusable, and layered components.
-the layer that the domain belongs to establishes what dependencies the microservices within that domain are allowed to take on.(Layer Design)

presentation


-Each service agnostic to other service. one service need not to know logic for other.
-SEARCH 
-considered as domain
-in macroservice there are Availability Risks. A single regression within a single code base can bring the whole system (in this case, all of Uber) down.

Getting ride-> contact near by drivers -> any one pick the request
-Can be considered as another domain

advantages
System reliability-service ca go down and roll back without affecting other
Separation of concerns
Clear Ownership - which code is own by which domain is known.
Developer Velocity. -teams deploy codes independently.
