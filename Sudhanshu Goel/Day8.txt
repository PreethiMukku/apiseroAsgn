Testing 

Testing is basically done to detect the bugs and errors when we run the Code .  
It also helps in increasing quality of the software and making software more reliable.

Test Driven Development 

In this the test cases are known before hand then according to the them developer develops the Code . So We adjust the code 
according to the errors that will occur when we do the testing 

Benefits oF this Approach 
	*Helps reduce the amount of time required for rework
	*Helps explore bugs or errors very quickly
	*Helps get faster feedback
	*Encourages the development of cleaner and better designs
	*Enhances the productivity of the programmer
	
Behaviour Driven Development
 
 In this approach various teams including customer , Non -Tech , Technical Onces sits together and then they dicusss the
 requirements of the project and discuss the procedure of the developmnet . It came with a SRS ( Software Requirement Specification)
 . After all these only the developer starts coding of the project .
 
 Benefits oF this Approach
	*Helps reach a wider audience by the usage of non-technical language
	*Focuses on how the system should behave from the customer’s and the developer’s perspective
	*BDD Is a cost-effective technique
	*Reduces efforts needed to verify any post-deployment defects
	
Coverage->
-Used while testing hence to make sure how much of code is under testing.
-can define test cases to methods.

SOAP services->
-XML data format is  used 
-loose coupling.
-Any protocol can be used .
-Operations can be defined by us.


REST services->
-Only HTTP protocol is used
-JSON format is only used 

Rest API has many requests such as 

1. GET 
2. POST 
3. PUT 
4. DELETE 
and many other 

And we have implemented these using Postman . By Using the app we have send the request and check the response . we take
Data from reqres.in website . For Request like PUT and DELETE we only send the data by writing them in body on the app 
and then we send it . We also Receive the Response in JSON format
