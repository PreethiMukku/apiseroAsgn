Why Cloud ?

In Today's era as technology is growing rapidly and we are in need to develop more and more new applications . Instead of
doing all by yourself we prefer shifting to cloud and using all the services offereed there. There are many Benefits of doing
so as We need worry much about update ,maintainability , scalability . It also reduce Cost . 

There are basically 5 charactersticts of using cloud

*On-demand self-service: We are to use the cloud services accoriding the demand or our requirement 

*Broad network access: The management capabilities are allowed to access over laptop, mobile, etc

*Resource pooling: There is always a pool of freely avaialable resources and its upto us how much we want to use . Pay will be 
also accoriding to the usage 

*Rapid elasticity: The resources can be easily scaled up or down according to the load .If suppose the requeste are more than more resources should be allocated(scaling up)and if the demand/requests decreases 
then the resources should be freed up(scale down).

*Measured Service: The cloud usage should be measured and monitored, and we pay per usage.

Now we Have Various Service Provide By Cloud 

--IaaS:Some services are already present in the cloud i.e network, storage, servers, virtualization and the OS
User need to just install and configure the middleware Applications 

--Paas: Addition to Iaas here we are also have the middlewares and runtimes provided by service provider where we can 
use those to have our own application. 


--Saas: Every thing are expilicity provided by the Service Provider only .Here User just need to use those services as they are 
without have to worry about configuration 

Relating to above steps we work on AWS and made some demo 

For Paas We make EC2 server instance and there we install node.js application and We try  printing Hello World on the server using AWS 

Next we make some auto scaling groups and check how the instances get scaled up or down according to the number of request that are coming .
We add 1 instance when the Network In goes greater than 10,000 / minute  and We remove 1 instance when Network In goes less than 2000 /Minute .

Now As we were working on more than One server so We also added a Load Balancer which is used to distribute load equally on the servers .
It used the round robin format to send the request to the servers.
