Integration :

- the process of bringing together the component sub-systems into one system
- all system function as a single system.
- with the use of integration we can improve productivity and quality of the software operations 

An example of Integration System is 

Infosys --> Flight booking--> Team(5..20)--> LocA-->LocB
	customization expectation----> B-B request
	Web/ Browser Client------------Servlet/jsp--------------component(Server)--------1 Db	
					tomcat
					Write web page-----------component(Server)--------1 Db	
					service()----------------component(Server)--------1 Db
					
Messaging 

- It is the exchange of message s (specially-formatted data describing events, requests, and replies) 
to a messaging server , which acts as a message exchange program for client programs.

Example as Java Message Service ( JMS ) provides messaging interfaces and services.

There are two major messaging server models: the point-to-point model and the publish/subscribe model.

P2P(Point to Point)
1. It ensures the guranteed delivery
2. There is only one receiver
3. A queue is maintained and once receiver gets the messaage then it is deleted from the queue.

Example is Gmail 

Publish Subscribe Model
1. Many receivers.
2. No guranteed delivery.

Example is You Tube 

OAuth 

- OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access 
their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single login credential
-We should use OAuth if we are building a service where you need to use a user's private data that is stored on another system
- Ex: Facebook, Google, Microsoft
