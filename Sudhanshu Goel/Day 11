DevOPs Stands for Development + Operations 

DevOps is Development and Operation's Collaboration, It's a Union of Process, People and Working Product that enable continuous integration and continuous 
delivery of value to our end users. 
DevOps accelerate the process to deliver applications and software services at high speed and high velocity.It is mostly used when we are 
developing microservices .

It consists of Business agility +trchnicwal innovattion + infrastructure choices 

 Business Agility :-
 
 1.Time-to market Accelaration 
 2.Rapid prototyping 
 3.Experimentation 
 4.Flexible partnering
 5.iot/ios support
 
 
 ---> SDLC : 
					- Planning.
					- System analysis and requirements.
					- Systems design
					- Development.
					- Integration and testing
					- Implementation
					- Operations and maintainence.
				
Some Example of Models that follows SDLC are
					-Waterfall Model
					-Iterative Model
					-Spiral Model
					-V-Model
					-Big Bang Model
					
				
---> Agile Methodology: 

- We have Gone through the manifesto . Four main Value in Agile 
		-Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
		-Working software over comprehensive documentation
		-Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
		-Responding to change over following a plan
							
 - 12 principles of Agile 

	-We follow these principles:
	-Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
	through early and continuous delivery
	of valuable software.

	-Welcome changing requirements, even late in
	development. Agile processes harness change for
	the customer's competitive advantage.

	-Deliver working software frequently, from a
	couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
	preference to the shorter timescale.

	-Business people and developers must work
	together daily throughout the project.

	-Build projects around motivated individuals.
	Give them the environment and support they need,
	and trust them to get the job done.

	-The most efficient and effective method of
	conveying information to and within a development
	team is face-to-face conversation.

	-Working software is the primary measure of progress.

	-Agile processes promote sustainable development.
	The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
	to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

	-Continuous attention to technical excellence
	and good design enhances agility.

	-Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
	of work not done--is essential.

	-The best architectures, requirements, and designs
	emerge from self-organizing teams.

	-At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
	to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
	its behavior accordingly.

 
 UAT ( User Acceptance Testing ) 
 
 1. Set Clear Exception
 2.UAT should occur early and Often
 3.Find relevant testing participants 
 4.Prepare test Assignments 
 5.Don't Focus Of Finding defects 
 6.Calrify all findings 
 7.Communication Feedback 
 
 
 JIRA 
 
 Jira was Developed in 2002 . It is bug and issue Tracker . It has evoled into a powerful work management tool for all use cases 
 from requirements and test case management to agile software development.
 
 Jira Consits of three things 
 
	- Jira Core : The Basic Jira Project management platform
	- Jira Software : Offers all functions of Jira Core , but also includes additional agile funtaionality 
	- Jira Helpdesk : meant For IT professionals or other forms of servoce desk 
	
-In jira software we created a project, added some collaborators 
-We created  issue in the software and can be  reported by any collaborator and assigned it to other collaborator(assignee). 
-This assigned collaborator will get notified and works on the bug/task given and updates the status (to do, in process, Done.)
 It also a chat option where two collaborator can communicate with each other . 
-Collaborators can also generate reports, leave comments for better interaction.
