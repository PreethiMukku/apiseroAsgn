RDBMS/SQL	
What is RDBMS->
-RDBMS means Relational Database Management Systems.
-Everything is structured as a relation or Table format.
-Table has columns and rows where Rows represent each record while Columns represent attributes or fields for record.
-examples, MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server.
-SQL- Structured Query Language.

-SQL has may oprations. They can be classified as DDL,DML,DQL.
-DDL->Data Definition Language
    -create a table
     create table dept(deptno int,dname varchar(14), loc varchar(13),constraint pk_dept primary key (deptno));
    -drop a table
     drop table dept;
    -alter a table
     alter table dept(deptno int,dname varchar(14), loc varchar(13),city varchar(20),constraint pk_dept primary key (deptno));
-DML->Data Manipulation Language
    -insert into table
     insert into dept (deptno,dname,loc) values (10, 'ACCOUNTING', 'NEW YORK');
    -update into table
     UPDATE dept SET dname = "ABC" WHERE deptno=10;
    -delete from table
     delete from dept where deptno=10;
-DQL->Data Query Language
    -SELECT
    -select * from dept;

Database Server/Client->
    -On same system/laptop
    -AWS installation(server)
    -MySQL server
    -chrome mysql plugin
    
CRUD of single table
-CRUD-> Create Retrieve Update Delete
     -Create
     create table dept(deptno int,dname varchar(14), loc varchar(13),constraint pk_dept primary key (deptno));
     -Retrieve
     select dname,city from dept;
     -Update
      update dept set dname = "ABC" WHERE deptname="HR";
     -Delete
     delete from dept where deptno=10;

Relationship in tables->
-Relationship in tables can be defined as below-
one-one->
    -one record in a table is associated with only one record in another table.
    -Emp(1)<-------->Address in Dept(1)
one-many->
    -one record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table.
    -Emp(1)<-------->Emails(*)
many-many->
    -many records in a table can have relation with many records in another table.
    -Students(*)<------->Subjects(*)

Fetching data from multiple tables->
-this can be done using joins.
-Joins / Unions->
-JOIN->
   -Inner join
   -Common records from both tables are retrieved.
   -SELECT d.deptno, count(e.empno) FROM dept d INNER JOIN emp e ON e.deptno = d.deptno GROUP BY d.deptno
   
   -Left join
   -retrieves all records from left table and common records from right table.
   -SELECT d.deptno, count(e.empno) FROM dept d LEFT JOIN emp e ON e.deptno = d.deptno GROUP BY d.deptno

    -Right join
   -retrieves all records from Right table and common records from right table.
   -SELECT d.deptno, count(e.empno) FROM dept d RIGHT JOIN emp e ON e.deptno = d.deptno GROUP BY d.deptno
-UNION
  -Union
  -Do not allow duplicates.
  SELECT City FROM Customers UNION SELECT City FROM Suppliers ORDER BY City;
  
  -Union all
  -Allows duplicate records
  SELECT City FROM Customers UNION ALL SELECT City FROM Suppliers ORDER BY City;

-SQL Queries->
-Find Maximum/minimum from column
-select job, max(sal) from emp
group by job
having job='MANAGER';
-select min(sal) from emp where job="PRESIDENT"

-get count
-select count(*) from emp;
