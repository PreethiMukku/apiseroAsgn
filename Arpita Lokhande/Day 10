Cloud computing->
-computing services over the internet such as network,storage,databases,servers,etc.
-we pay only for cloud services we use.
-low operating costs.
-scaling of business

***********

Why to use Cloud->

-for a project we need->
-server machines->have to pay large for it.
-services-their pay/usage
-Maintainance is high-Installation,configuration,H/W,S/W support.

-we need infraastructure-> networking,virtualisation,servers,storage.
-we need platform->OS,Middleware,Runtime
-we need Software->Application, Data.

-Cloud provides services like infrastructure,platform and software.

IAAS->
-In this cloud service provides us infrastructure as a service.
-All networking,servers, storage,virtualisation is managed by cloud.
- we manage the rest.
-Amazon Web services AWS

PAAS->
-In this cloud service provides us Platform as a service.
-All networking,servers, storage,virtualisation also with OS needed, Middleware applications and Runtime environment is managed by cloud.
- we manage the rest.
-online code compilers.

SAAS->
-In this cloud service provides us Software as a service.
-Here everything is managed by the cloud,we just use this services.
eg,zoom,Cisco WebEx.

cloud Advantages->
1.On demand self service
-can activate the services whenever consumer wants it.
2.broad network access
-mobiles,laptop all devices have access.
3.Resource pooling
-location independent,can access from any location.
4.Rapid Elasticity
-scale up, scale down
5.Measured service
-we pay for what we use.
6.Multitenacity
-multiple consumers can use one service at time.
****************

Client-----Load Balancer----Auto Scaling
Autoscaling group
-it contains all EC2 instances which are created for that project.
-when we specify autoscaling, instance gets automatically created.
-we can set maximum, minimum and desired capacities for whatever scale up and scale down we need.

Loadbalancer->
-multiple services can have multiple load balancers.
-Can be used in EC2 instances in aws.

-Scaling policies
-we can define scaling policies. eg. simple scaling
-we can add cloudwatch alarm.
-through this we can set actions like adding or removing capacity units.
-and wait for certain timestrand specified by us for allowing capacity.
