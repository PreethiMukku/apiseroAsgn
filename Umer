-> Programming Fundamentals
 -> Different orientations
    -> Procedure Oriented 
      - C , Pascal
      - Flow of Execution 
    -> object oriented
      - Data
      - Methods
      - Classes
      - Objects
    -> Component oriented
      - Activex, Com/Dcom, RMI, EJB
 -> OOPS concepts
   -> Encapsulation - wrapping data and methods as a single unit.
   -> Abstraction - Hiding the implementation details and only providing essentails functionality to the user.
   -> Inheritance - Inheriting properties from class.
     - Comman data members
     - Code resuse
     - Type
     
        class Emp1 extends Emp
              {
          
              }
     - Single inheritance
     - Multiple inheritance
     - Multi level inheritance

   -> Interface - Contains abstract methods 
      -> class which implements the Interface must define all its methods.
      -> A class can implement many interfaces but can only extend one class.
      
          Interface Emp{

             public void print();
           }
          class Emp1 implements Emp
           {
          
             public void print()
              {
                 // definition
              }
           } 
    -> Polymorphism   
      - one thing , many forms.
      - method overloading 
        -depending on the context changes form.
      - method overriding 
        - in inheritance
