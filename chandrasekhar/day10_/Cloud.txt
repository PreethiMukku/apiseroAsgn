Cloud computing->
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
On-demand self-service. Cloud computing resources can be provisioned without human interaction from the service provider. ...
Broad network access. ...
Multi-tenancy and resource pooling. ...
Rapid elasticity and scalability. ...
Measured service.

Why to use Cloud->

Machine -> servers(3)
        -> Load balancer(1)
client  -> Load balancer-->s1,s2,s3
software and hardware
4 spare machines --> money wastage
100 requests -> 1 server
10000 requests -> 5 servers (costs to buy increases)
Instead of this we can have services to use and pay for what we use 
->purchsing all these machines rental bases-> services
    -> service ->pay per usage
    -> cost
    -> maintainability -> installation, configuration, hardware, software support


-Cloud provides services like infrastructure,platform and software.

IAAS-(infrastructure as a service.)
-All networking,servers, storage,virtualisation is managed by cloud.
- we need to manage all the other like os, middleware, software etc.
-Amazon Web services AWS

PAAS-(Platform as a service.)
-All networking,servers, storage,virtualisation, Operating system, Middleware applications and Runtime environment is managed by cloud.
- we need to take of pthers like software.
-online code compilers.

SAAS-(Software as a service.)
-each and every thing is managed by the cloudn from networking to software,we just use this services.
-zoom calls

cloud essential characteristics
1.On demand self service
-can activate the services whenever consumer wants it.
2.broad network access
-mobiles,laptop all devices have access.
3.Resource pooling
-location independent,can access from any location.
4.Rapid Elasticity
-scale up, scale down
5.Measured service
-we pay for what we use.
6.Multitenacity
-multiple consumers can use one service at time.

Client------->Load Balancer------->Auto Scaling
Autoscaling
- scale up scale down is done automatically.
- autoscaling params
if morethan 10000 requests create one more instance 
if lessthan 2000 requests delete one instance
-it contains all EC2 instances which are created for that project.
-when we specify autoscaling, instance gets automatically created.

Loadbalancer-
-load balancer uses round robin for server allocation.
-Can be used in EC2 instances in aws.
-load balancer helps for server allocation in faster and efficient way.

-Real time Scenario
client -----> load balancer-----> target form(auto scaling)
Autoscaling is mostly used when we have unknown load on the load balancer through n number of requests.
