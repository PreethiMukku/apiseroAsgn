--------Testing---------
testing is simply executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements.

--------TDD--------
-In TDD (Test Driven Development), the test is written to check the implementation of functionality, but as the code evolves, tests can give false results. 
-tests are written, before writing the bare minimum of code
-The code will then be refactored in order to pass the test, with the process being repeated for each piece of functionality.

The sequence of steps for TDD as below:

Write test
Run test
Check for failed tests
Make changes to the code
Repeat from step 2 until the system passes all test cases.

---------BDD---------
-BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is also a test-first approach, but differs by testing the actual behavior of the system from the end users perspective.
-written in a shared language, which improves communication between tech and non-tech teams and stakeholders. 
-tests are written ahead of the code, but in BDD, tests are more user-focused and based on the systemâ€™s behavior.

----------SOA--------
Service Oriented Architecture
style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.

-----------SOAP-------
Simple Object Access Protocol
XML based messaging protocol
uses wsdl for communication between consumer and provider
transfer is ovet HTTP and also SMTP,FTP etc
result returned is not human readable.

---------REST--------
Representational state transfer
An architectural style protocol
Uses XML or JSON to receive and send data
transfer is over HTTP only
result is human readable like xml or json mostly

REST sevice request 
we can check by looking in reqres.in website to see various operational requests where postman is used(testing REST API)
-----GET----- 
Request /api/users?page=2
Response ok 200 

----POST-----
Request /api/users
Response ok 201

------PUT----
Request /api/users/2
Response ok 200

-----DELETE-----
Request /api/users/2
Response 204(NO response)
